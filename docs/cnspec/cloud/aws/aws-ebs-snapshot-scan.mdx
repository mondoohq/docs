description: This document covers the configuration and use of the Mondoo AWS Integration to scan AWS accounts and EC2 Instances
---

Mondoo can scan your EBS volume snapshots to evaluate the security and compliance of Linux-based EC2 instances. It doesn't require an agent or any connection to the instance that could impact your business applications.

Snapshot scanning with Mondoo relies on [cnspec](/cnspec/cnspec-about/), Mondoo's CLI security tool.

## Scan EBS volumes

### Create a VM for EBS volume scanning

1. Spin up a small EC2 instance (for example an Amazon Linux instance with the type `t2.micro`) where you'll attach the EBS snapshot.

2. [Install cnspec on the new instance](/cnspec/) and [register it in the Mondoo Console](/cnspec/cnspec-platform/).

### Create an IAM policy for EBS volume scanning

1. Log into the AWS console.
2. Navigate to **IAM**.
3. In the side navigation, select **Policies**.
4. Select the **Create policy** button.
5. Under **Specify permissions** select **JSON**, add the following block and select "Next":

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "ec2:AttachVolume",
        "ec2:DetachVolume",
        "ec2:DeleteVolume",
        "ec2:DeleteSnapshot"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "ec2:CreateSnapshot",
        "ec2:CreateVolume",
        "ec2:CopySnapshot",
        "ec2:CreateTags",
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
        "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:ReEncryptTo",
        "kms:GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext",
        "kms:DescribeKey",
        "kms:ReEncryptFrom"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "kms:GrantIsForAWSResource": "true"
        }
      },
      "Action": "kms:CreateGrant",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}
```

6. Under **Policy details** -> **Policy name** give the policy a name such as **ebs-scanning-mondoo**, assign tags and a description to the role (if you want), and then select **Create policy**.

### Create an IAM role for EBS volume scanning

1. Log into the AWS console.
2. Navigate to **IAM**.
3. Select **Roles**.
4. Select **Create Role**.
5. For the **Trust entity type**, select **AWS service** and for the **Use case**, select **EC2**, the select the "Next" button.
6. Search for **ebs** in the **Filter policies** box, select the policy you just created **ebs-scanning-mondoo**, and then select the "Next" button.
7. Under **Role details** in the field "Role name" give the role a name **ebs**, assign tags and a description to the role (if you want), and then select **Create role**.

### Attach the new IAM role (`ebs`) to your new EC2 instance.

Your new role is ready for use and can be attached to existing EC2 instances, or to new EC2 instances as an [instance profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html) when launching new instances.

### Using your new EC2 instance for scanning

1. Log into your new EC2 instance.

2. Scan a snapshot from your new instance:

```bash
cnspec scan aws ec2 ebs snapshot SNAPSHOT_ID
```

For SNAPSHOT_ID, substitute the ID of the snapshot, for example `snap-123456b123a123da2` .
