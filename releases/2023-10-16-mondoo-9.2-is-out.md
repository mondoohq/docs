## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Secure Atlassian services

Our new Atlassian cnquery/cnspec provider allows you to query the configuration of Atlassian's suite of products, including Jira and Confluence.

Use the Atlassian provider with `cnquery shell` to connect to your Atlassian URL using a user or admin token:

```bash
cnquery shell atlassian --host https://luna.atlassian.net --admin-token FOO
```

Some example data you can query using this provider and resources:

```coffeescript
atlassian.admin.organizations: [
  0: atlassian.admin.organization id="4j1ack42-6c9d-1552-k55a-c2j536j31066"

Learn more about the capabilities of this new provider and its resources in the [Atlassian resource pack documentation](/mql/resources/atlassian-pack/).

Stay tuned for an Atlassian policy bundle that lets you continuously secure your business' Atlassian usage.

### New `http` resource

Use our new `http` resource to continuously secure and assure compliance for HTTP endpoints used by your business.

```coffeescript
http.get('https://console.mondoo.com') { statusCode version header{ xFrameOptions xContentTypeOptions referrerPolicy sts csp['base-uri'] } }
```

Returns:

```coffeescript
http.get: {
  header: {
    csp[base-uri]: "'self'"
    xContentTypeOptions: "nosniff"
    referrerPolicy: "same-origin"
    xFrameOptions: "SAMEORIGIN"
    sts: http.header.sts maxAge=365 days  includeSubDomains=true preload=false
  }
  version: "2.0"
  statusCode: 200
}
```

Learn more about these new fields at our [http.get](/mql/resources/network-pack/http.get/) and [http.header](/mql/resources/network-pack/http.header/) documentation.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Expanded Azure resources

Azure networking resources continue to receive updates to expose critical information for security and compliance within your Azure infrastructure:

#### azure.subscription.networkService.virtualNetworkGateway.ipConfig

- New `publicIpAddress` field: The public IP address associated with this IP configuration

#### azure.subscription.networkService.natGateway

- New `publicIpAddresses` field: List of public IP addresses the NAT gateway is associated with

#### azure.subscription.networkService.virtualNetwork

- New `dhcpOptions` field: Virtual network DHCP options
- New `enableDdosProtection` field: Whether DDoS protection is enabled for all the protected resources in the virtual network
- New `enableVmProtection` field: Whether VM protection is enabled for all the subnets in the virtual network

### More AWS console links

AWS console links let you jump directly from Mondoo scan results to the scanned assets in the AWS console. Use these handy shortcuts to make updates quickly based on Mondoo findings. We've expanded this support with direct console links from Mondoo DynamoDB, KMS, CloudTrail, and EBS volumes assets.
