## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Application CVE detection

We've all been on the Zoom meeting when our coworkers share their screens and every browser window shows the "relaunch to update" badge. How long has Bob in accounting been browsing the web with that unpatched browser? A day? A week? A month? It's hard to know your organization's level of exposure if vulnerability scanning stops at the OS. Go further with new application CVE detection for non-OS installed packages, starting with the detection of vulnerable Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome releases.

A new Software tab on the asset detail page shows Mondoo-detected software vulnerabilities. Details include impact level and additional risk factors if known exploits exist for the application.

Want to view data on an asset's individual vulnerabilities? New Vulnerabilities and Advisories tabs let you dive directly into the individual risks on your assets.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### CIS Microsoft 365 Foundations 3.0 policy

Mondoo now includes version 3.0 of the CIS Microsoft 365 Benchmark policy. This updated policy includes new and updated checks to keep your Microsoft 365 environment secure, including:

- 10 new Microsoft Teams checks
- 8 new Microsoft SharePoint checks
- 6 new Microsoft Power BI checks
- 15 updated checks with improved descriptions, remediations, and query values

### Improved CIS Azure Foundations policy queries

Reworked queries in the CIS Azure Foundations Benchmark policy provide more reliable results and improved output so you can quickly find and secure your Azure resources.

### Improved asset overview information

Understand your assets at a glance using expanded asset overview information in Mondoo 10.1. New cloud, hardware manufacturer, hardware model, and serial number data are included for operating systems, allowing you to quickly track down assets.

### Expanded macOS and Windows inventory packs

We've expanded the Windows and macOS inventory packs to expose critical asset configuration data.

#### macOS queries

- SMBIOS system information
- Storage data
- Power data
- Network data
- Configuration profile data
- Uptime
- Running processes
- Kernel modules
- Mounts
- Active network connections
- SSHd configuration

#### Windows queries

- Uptime
- Running processes
- Scheduled tasks
- Expanded data for BitLocker volumes
- Expanded data for security products
- Expanded data for services

### CVE detection on Linux Mint

Keep your Linux workstations fresh with expanded CVE detection support for Linux Mint.

### Improved Azure authentication

No matter how you pass your authentication, Mondoo has your back with expanded authentication capabilities for scanning Azure subscriptions. Previously, running `cnspec scan azure` only loaded authentication credentials from the `azure` CLI. Now, scans can also load credentials from shell environment variables, workload identity, and managed identity, in addition to the CLI configuration.

### CVSS scores in JSONL exports

Data integrations now export JSONL data with CVSS scores, so you can feed this critical risk data into external systems that consume your data exports.

### Resource improvements

Dive deep into your Azure environment in the cnquery shell and create custom policies with an expanded MQL resource.

#### azure.subscription.computeService.vm

- New `zones` field
- New `state` field
- New `isRunning` field
