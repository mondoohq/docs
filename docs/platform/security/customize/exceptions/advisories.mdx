Set _advisory exceptions_ to customize how Mondoo evaluates your assets. Advisory exceptions tell Mondoo to exclude certain [advisories](/platform/security/posture/advisories/) when assessing an asset's security posture.

If an asset has advisories that, for any reason, you don't want to include in your assessments, you can _disable_ them. Doing so instructs Mondoo to skip them entirely. Mondoo doesn't prioritize disabled advisories or include them when evaluating the asset's vulnerability to attack.

You can temporarily exclude an advisory by setting it to Risk Accepted. While an advisory is in this state, it won't affect the asset's vulnerability score. Use Risk Acceptance when you intend to address an advisory later but want to prevent it from impacting your team's current priorities.

## Disable or snooze an advisory

import Partial from "../../../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the space containing the asset.

   You can also select a [workspace](/platform/start/organize/workspaces/) to view a subset of assets within a space.

## Approve or reject an exception

Exceptions take effect the moment they're added. However, as an extra tracking step, a team member can approve or reject an exception:

- Approving an exception allows it to remain.

- Rejecting an exception removes it.

To approve or reject an exception:

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the space in which you want to approve or deny exceptions.
