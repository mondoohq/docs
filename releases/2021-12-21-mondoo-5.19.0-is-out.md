ü•≥ mondoo 5.19.0 is out!

### üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

- Make asset name consistent for AWS instances regardless of the transport or discovery mechanism used
- Add additional fields to the`aws.rds.dbinstance` resource
  - `dbInstanceClass`: name of the compute and memory capacity class of the DB instance
  - `dbInstanceIdentifier`: user-supplied unique key that identifies a DB instance
  - `engine`: name of the database engine for this DB instance
  - `securityGroups`: list of VPC security group elements that the DB instance belongs to
  - `status`: current state of this database
- Detect services managed by systemd for FS based transports
- Handle Terraform template wrap expressions
- Add advisory support for Ubuntu 21.10
- Improve printing of assessments for blocks

### üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- `mondoo scan -o` now accepts `json` and `yml` for report output formats. Before, `json` support was claimed but did not work, and `yaml` support worked, but did not accept `yml`
- Fix panic when using the AWS S3 resource
- Fix potential panic if scan results fail to store
- Fix issue where the assessment for `package("foo").installed` would be missing, but `package("foo").installed == true` would work
- Fix bug where AWS S3 buckets without tags return an error when no tags are present
- Update asset filter for `CIS Distribution Independent Linux Benchmark Level 1 for Container` so that it only runs for containers
- Use public IP instead of public DNS for EC2 Instance Connect since not all instances have a public DNS entry
