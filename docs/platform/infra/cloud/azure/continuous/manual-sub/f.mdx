This is the sixth step in the manual setup for an Azure subscription.

## Step F: Upload the application certificate.

The app registration and your Mondoo integration must share a [PEM](https://aboutssl.org/what-is-pem-certificate-file/) (privacy-enhanced mail) certificate for secure authentication. The certificate must not be password protected.

Create a PEM certificate using the method approved by your organization's security team. You need two files:

- The file you upload to Azure must have only the certificate, not the private key.

- The file you upload to Mondoo Console (in the [Add a new Azure integration in the Mondoo Console](#add-a-new-azure-integration-in-the-mondoo-console) section below) must have both the private key and the certificate. It must have a `.pem` extension and must use this format and order of information:

  ```
  -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
  key goes here
  -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  certificate goes here
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  ```

<summary>Generate a self-signed certificate for testing</summary>

For testing purposes only, you can use OpenSSL toolkit together with req to generate a certificate. Run this command in Linux shell, macOS shell, or Azure Cloud shell (bash):

```
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096  -x509  -sha512  -days 365 -nodes -out certificate.pem -keyout privatekey.key
```

Add the private key to the beginning of the PEM file:

```
cat privatekey.key certificate.pem > certificate.combo.pem
```

</details>

Upload the certificate to Azure:

1. From the Azure portal home, select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

2. In the navigation sidebar, select **App registrations**.

3. Select the app you created.

4. In the sidebar under the app name, select **Certificate & secrets**.

5. Select **Certificates** and then select **Upload certificate**.

6. Select the PEM certificate and enter a description, such as `Mondoo certificate`.

Be sure to choose the file containing only the certificate, not the private key.

7. Select the **Add** button.
