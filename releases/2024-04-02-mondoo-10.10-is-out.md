## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### XZ Utils Vulnerability policy

The recent xz supply chain attack in xz 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 (CVE-2024–3094) thankfully didn't make it in any mainstream enterprise Linux distributions. There's still a significant risk if employees are running rolling distributions or pre-releases of upcoming Linux distros. To quickly evaluate your CVE-2024–3094 expose we've created a new xz Vulnerability (CVE-2024–3094) policy that looks for xz 5.6.0/5.6.1 on impacted Linux releases:

- Alpine
- Arch
- Debian trixie/sid
- Fedora 40
- Kali 2024.1
- openSUSE Tumbleweed

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Improved AWS asset overview information

Get the context you need to resolve security findings quickly with expanded overview information on AWS assets:

- Volume size on EBS volumes and snapshots
- Database engine version on RDS instances
- Storage size and type on RDS instances
- Table size on DynamoDB tables
- Retention time on CloudWatch log groups

### Expanded Endpoint Detection and Response policy support

Detect the ESET EDR in the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) policy.

### New Terraform checks in CIS GCP Foundation policy

Flag critical security misconfigurations before they're ever running in your infrastructure with expanded Terraform config checks in the CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation policy. New checks evaluate Terraform configs for proper [GCP uniform bucket level access](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uniform-bucket-level-access) setup.

### Fedora 40 EOL/CVE detection

The [Fedora 40 beta](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/fedora-40-beta-now-available) is now available for testing, and Mondoo is ready with CVE and EOL detection for this upcoming Linux release. Keep your test systems safe from critical vulnerabilities such as the compromised xz release (CVE-2024–3094) that originally shipped in this beta.
