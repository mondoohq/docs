🥳 mondoo 5.25.0 is out!

### 🎉 NEW FEATURES

**Improved mondoo inventory command**

Debugging the inventory was not easy since most of the details were hidden. This made it difficult to tell users when to e.g. convert files. To mitigate this, we are adding two new commands:

- `mondoo inventory init` - creates a new sample inventory file
- `mondoo inventory convert` - e.g converts an ansible inventory to a Mondoo inventory

Example:

```
mondoo inventory convert --inventory-fileraspi-scan.json --inventory-ansible
→ load inventory inventory=raspi-scan.json
metadata: {}
spec:
  assets:
  - connections:
    - Sudo: {}
      backend: 3
      credentials:
      - secret_id: 24SXpBDcZRg85oDU4MSsqm6S2iH
      host: raspberrypi
    name: instance1
  credentials:
    24SXpBDcZRg85oDU4MSsqm6S2iH:
      private_key_path: /Users/chris/.ssh/chris-rock.rsa
      secret: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBSU0EgUFJJVkFURSBLRVktLS0tLQpNSUl
      secret_id: 24SXpBDcZRg85oDU4MSsqm6S2iH
      type: private_key
      user: pi
```

**Organization Resolver for Google Cloud**

With this new change, we are adding support to discover projects for GCP organizations.
There are two methods to scan projects in GCP listed below.

Method 1: Auto-discovers current project from gcloud

```bash
mondoo scan -t gcp
```

Method 2: Provide a specific project

```bash
mondoo scan -t gcp --option project=your_project
```

We added the ability to discover all projects by adding the `--option organization=12345678` and `--discover projects` flags. Here is an example:

```
$ gcloud organizations list
mondoo.com     12345678              AAAAB7cc5

$ mondoo scan -t gcp --option organization=12345678 --discover projects
```

### 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

- Allow user to specify pagination command using the `PAGER` environment variable or `--pager 'pagerCmd'` flag
- Add createTime field to `aws.ec2.volume` resource
- The inventory flags for the mondoo CLI have been harmonized:
  - `--inventory` has been deprecated in favor of `--inventory-file`
  - `--ansible-inventory` has been deprecated in favor of `--inventory-ansible`
  - `--domainlist-inventory` has been deprecated in favor of `--inventory-domainlist`

### 🐛 BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Fix bug where mondoo command would try to use less pager when it wasn't available on the system
- Fix bug where an incorrect stop execution error message was printed
- Fix bug where certain errors could cause execution to stall
