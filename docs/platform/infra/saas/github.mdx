description: Assess the security of your GitHub repositories and organization with Mondoo
---

You can configure Mondoo to continuously scan an entire GitHub organization or individual repositories. Mondoo scans find misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that put your business at risk. You deploy the integration once and always get the latest security assessments.

:::tip

You can also use Mondoo to automatically scan Kubernetes manifests, Terraform configuration files, and Docker containers in GitHub Actions. To learn more, read [Scan in GitHub Actions](/platform/infra/supply/cicd/github-actions/).

:::

## Prerequisite

- [A Mondoo account](/platform/start/plat-start-acct/)

- Access to a GitHub organization or repository

## Create a GitHub personal access token to give Mondoo access to the repository

A _personal access token_ gives Mondoo the ability to access GitHub resources on your behalf. For Mondoo to continuously monitor your GitHub repository, you must create a personal access token.

To learn more about personal access tokens, read [Managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) in the GitHub documentation.

1. Log into GitHub. If you haven't verified your email address with GitHub, do that now.

2. In the upper-right corner of any GitHub page, select your profile photo and then select Settings.

3. In the left sidebar, select **Developer settings**.

4. In the left sidebar, under **Personal access tokens**, select **Tokens (classic)**.

5. Near the top-right corner of the page, select the **Generate new token** drop-down and select **Generate new token (classic)**.

6. Under **Note**, explain the purpose of the token, such as `Mondoo security scan access`.

7. Under **Expiration**, specify the number of days before the token expires.

8. Under **Select scopes**, check these boxes:

   - read:org
   - read:repo_hook
   - admin:org_hook
   - read:project

9. Select the **Generate token** button.

10. Copy the token that GitHub generates. You need in in the next steps.

## Set up a GitHub integration

1. Access the Integrations > Add > GitHub page in one of two ways:

   - New space setup: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then under **SaaS**, select **GitHub**.

   - INTEGRATIONS page: In the side navigation bar, under **INTEGRATIONS**, select **Add New Integration**. Under SaaS, select **GitHub**.

2. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that lets you easily recognize the GitHub organization or repository.

3. Under **Select your integration type**, choose whether to continuously scan an entire organization or a single repository.

4. Specify the organization or repository to scan:

   - If you're scanning an organization, type its name in the **Organization** box.

     If you want to control which repositories in the organization to scan, turn off **Scan all repositories found within the provided organization** and specify the names of repositories to include or to skip. Type each repository on a new line.

   - If you're scanning a repository, in the **Owner** box, enter the name of the GitHub user or organization that owns the repository you want to monitor. In the **Repository** box, enter the name of the repository. Find these values in the URL path to the repository landing page. For example, this owner's name is _Lunalectric_ and the repository is _frontend_:

   ![GitHub organization name](/img/platform/infra/saas/github/repo.png)

5. In the **Provide your personal access token** box, paste the GitHub token you generated in the previous section.

6. Select the **START SCANNING** button.

7. On the Recommended Policies page, enable the policies on which you want to base assessments of your GitHub repository. To learn more, read [Manage Policies](/platform/security/posture/policies/).

   Mondoo begins scanning your GitHub repository and, when completed, presents results on the INVENTORY page.
