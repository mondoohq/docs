## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Organization overview dashboard

We've added a new overview dashboard that lets you see the health of all your infrastructure at a glance.

Mondoo spaces are a great way to organize your scanned assets in Mondoo. You can group assets in ways that reflect how your company manages infrastructure, apply policies to all the assets in a space with a single action, and allow teams to concentrate on their area of responsibility.

The new overview dashboard gives you a single view to see what's happening in every Mondoo space. See how asset scores are trending over time, track the vulnerabilities Mondoo detects wherever they appear in your infrastructure, and compare spaces to see how different business areas manage compliance and risk obligations.

Quickly see the most vulnerable assets in your infrastructure and tackle the most critical issues first.

We have big plans here and we're eager for your feedback.

### Policy preview

We've added a way to preview policies in your spaces, so you can see the results of new checks and queries without impacting your scores.

Previewed policies still fully execute, but the results aren't counted into your scores until you decide they are. As a result, teams get visibility into their infrastructure without worrying about creating surprises or awkward conversations with management.

![Policy View](/img/releases/2023-04-18-mondoo-8.6-is-out/policy_with_preview.png)

Policies can be previewed directly from the Security Registry by selecting the "Preview" icon. Previewed policies will appear on scanned assets with a blue light bulb.

### Customize policy properties in the console

We've added a way to configure the properties on a property directly from the Mondoo Console.

Policy properties let you customize policies in ways that make sense to you without creating a fork of the entire policy. For example, you can use properties to adjust a maximum password age, modify a list of recommended ciphers, or create an allowlist of packages to continue utilizing beyond vendor EOL. Edit the properties directly from the Mondoo Console Registry.
