## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### All new cnspec and cnquery clients!

Up to this point, both cnquery and cnspec had all connectors and providers built into one binary file each. This was great when we only had a few connectors and things were small. Recently, however, the binaries have exploded in size with every new technology that we added. Since both projects are designed to also run on small devices and embedded controllers, we wanted to change this approach for some time now.

**This release includes entirely new binaries for cnquery and cnspec. Both are 90% smaller, re-usable, and extensible now!**

1. **Provider plugins**

   When you connect to any technology (like AWS, Azure, K8s, etc) we now install a dedicated provider for that technology. This happens automatically for all core technologies we support:

   ```bash
   > cnquery run aws -c asset.name
   → installing provider 'aws' version=9.0.8
   → successfully installed aws provider path=/home/zero/.config/mondoo/providers/aws version=9.0.8
   → loaded configuration from /home/zero/.config/mondoo/mondoo.yml using source default
   asset.name: "AWS Account lunalectric-management (177043759486)"
   ```

   These provider plugins are shared between cnquery and cnspec. If you install any provider for cnquery, it is available to cnspec and vice versa.

2. **Automatic updates**

   Providers are automatically updated to the latest version of the current major release:

   ```bash
   ~ $> cnspec shell aws
   → found a new version for 'aws' provider installed=9.0.5 latest=9.0.8
   → successfully installed aws provider path=/home/zero/.config/mondoo/providers/aws version=9.0.8
   ...
   ```

   We avoid breaking changes during all major versions and will notify users of deprecations with a full major version of grace period, during which you can use deprecated features.

   For containers and restricted environments, you can turn off updates via `--auto-update=false` or `auto_update: false` in the config file. This will prevent existing providers from getting updated and prevent new providers from being installed.

   For example: If you install cnquery or cnspec on a container, you can pre-install all providers you aim to use with it. At the end of the build process you then deactivate the auto-update in the config file.

3. **Custom providers**

   You can view all providers via the `providers` subcommand:

   ```bash
   > cnquery providers

   → builtin (found 2 providers)

     core 9.0.1
     mock 9.0.0 with connectors: mock

   → /home/zero/.config/mondoo/providers (found 4 providers)

     aws 9.0.8 with connectors: aws
     azure 9.0.4 with connectors: azure
     gitlab 9.0.4 with connectors: gitlab
     os 9.0.8 with connectors: local, ssh, winrm, vagrant, container, docker, filesystem

   → /opt/mondoo/providers has no providers
   ```

   This command not only prints the current providers and versions, but it also shows the locations in which providers are installed.

   In the coming days we will share written and video guides on how to create your very own provider. In the meantime, feel free to check out cnquery's "[providers](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery/tree/main/providers)" folder with lots of examples! All providers are distributed as binaries with a proto interface, so you can write them in Go or any other language with GRPC support.

   You can now create custom providers and install them everywhere you want to run them! This also includes restricted code that may use your company's internal APIs and which you don't want to publish. Mondoo will support the schema-upload shortly so you can see results in our UI without exposing any code.

### Hassle-free asset discovery in GitLab scans

We've removed the pain of manually discovering assets throughout your GitLab environment with new hassle-free asset discovery. The GitLab Mondoo Platform integration and the `cnspec` CLI now include options to automatically discover all GitLab projects, groups, and even Terraform files within your GitLab projects. Set it once and continuously scan your entire environment to secure your software supply chain and the Terraform files that define your infrastructure.

![GitLab Setup](/img/releases/2023-10-05-mondoo-9.0-is-out/gitlab.png)

New cnspec GitLab discovery options:

```bash
cnspec scan gitlab --token TOKEN <- returns all groups the user has access to
cnspec scan gitlab --token TOKEN --discover groups <- returns the defined group and all subgroups of that group
cnspec scan gitlab --token TOKEN --discover projects <- returns all the projects discovered in all the groups the user has access to
cnspec scan gitlab --token TOKEN --discover terraform  <- returns all the Terraform files in all the projects discovered in all the groups the user has access to
```

### Set asset annotations during client login

Asset annotations let you add additional information on assets that can't necessarily be detected using Mondoo resources. Traditionally, these annotations have been set in the console on each asset page, but now you can automate setting annotations during the client registration process. This allows you to pass in data like employee workstation asset tags from an MDM solution.

Setting annotations during the client login:

```shell
cnspec login --token <token> --annotation assetid=MONDOO1234 --annotation location=PDX
```

### MQL improvements

Mondoo 9.0 further improves MQL so you can more easily query assets in your environment and write custom security policies.

#### Simple accessors for unstructured data

Accessing structures in JSON, Terraform, and Kubernetes has often been painful:

```coffee
dict["one"]["more"]["field"]
```

To make it easier to access these nested fields, we've introduced a new optional syntax. This is well-known from other scripting languages (like JS and TS):

```coffee
dict.one.more.field
```

This mode continues to support our GraphQL foundation:

```coffee
dict {
  one { more.field }
  two
  ...
}
```

It has helped simplify many use-cases for Terraform and Kubernetes:

```coffee
# OLD:
tfblock {
  _["attributes"]["account_id"]["value"]
}

# NEW:
tfblock {
  attributes.account_id.value
}
```

#### Empty type

With the new `empty` type, there's no need for complex logic to check for different kinds of empty values. Each of these common situations evaluate as `empty`:

```coffee
[] == empty
null == empty
'' == empty
{} == empty
```

A single query can now check for an empty value in any type of data:

```coffee
users.list == empty
```

### Expanded platform EOL data
