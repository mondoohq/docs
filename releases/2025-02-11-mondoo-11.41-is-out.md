## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### AWS RDS Cluster support

AWS account scans now include automatic discovery of RDS clusters. Cluster assets appear on the Assets page in a new RDS Clusters group and each asset includes full inventory information.

### More view options for asset lists

We've updated the Assets page to make finding and selecting the assets you care about easier than ever. Improved search results show just the asset groups that include results. A new empty state makes it more clear when no assets match your search. New group and list icons let you switch between views: organize by platform groups or display a single list so you can sort and select all assets of a certain asset group at once.
