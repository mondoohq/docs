title: Prioritizing Risk with Top Actions
sidebar_label: Overview
---

In any modern IT environment, the number of security alerts can be overwhelming. The critical challenge is not just finding issues, but knowing which ones to fix first.

Mondoo's prioritization philosophy is designed to solve this problem. We provide data-driven metrics that help you focus on the 20% of fixes that can eliminate 80% of your actual risk. This strategy is delivered through a focused feature called **Top Actions**.

### Introducing Top Actions

**Top Actions** is a curated list of the 30 vulnerabilities that, if remediated, will provide the single greatest improvement to your overall [Space Risk Score](./understanding-space-risk-score.mdx).

Instead of leaving you to sort through thousands of findings, Mondoo does the analytical work for you, presenting a clear, actionable list of what to fix next. This list is powered by two key metrics:

- **Risk Reduction (Impact):** A precise calculation of how much your security score will improve when you fix a finding across all affected assets.
- **Effort (Cost):** An estimate of the time required to remediate a finding, contrasting the hours of manual work with the minutes needed for Mondoo's automation.

By using the Top Actions list, you can move from a reactive state of alert fatigue to a proactive strategy of targeted, high-impact remediation.
