This is the final step in the manual setup for an Azure subscription.

## Add a new Azure integration in the Mondoo Console

After you've created, granted permissions to, and tested a new app registration, you can create a Mondoo Azure integration. You need some values from the app registration you created in the instructions above.

1. Access the Integrations > Add > Azure page in one of two ways:

   - New space setup: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **Azure**.

   - INTEGRATIONS page: In the side navigation bar, under **INTEGRATIONS**, select **Add New Integration**. Under Cloud Security, select **Azure**.

2. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that lets you easily recognize the Azure tenant.

3. In the **Enter Application (client) ID** box, enter the value from the app registration's **Application (client) ID** box.

4. In the **Enter the Directory (tenant) ID** box, enter the value from the app registration's **Directory (tenant) ID** box.

5. Specify the subscriptions for Mondoo to continuously scan.

   - To continuously scan all subscriptions in the tenant, leave the **Scan all subscriptions connected to the Directory (tenant) ID** toggle enabled.

   - To choose the subscriptions to scan, disable the **Scan all subscriptions connected to the Directory (tenant) ID** toggle, select Allowlist, and enter the subscription ID to scan.

   - To scan **all** subscriptions except those you specify, disable the **Scan all subscriptions connected to the Directory (tenant) ID** toggle, select Denylist, and enter the names of the subscriptions you don't want Mondoo to scan.

6. To automatically discover all Linux and Windows VMs in your subscription and scan them using Azure Run Command, select **Scan Azure VMs using Run Command**.

7. Provide a certificate (a [PEM](https://aboutssl.org/what-is-pem-certificate-file/) (privacy-enhanced mail) file) for Mondoo to securely authenticate with the app (service principal) you created.

   The certificate file must have the `.pem` extension and must contain both the private key and the certificate in this order:

   ```
   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   key goes here
   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   certificate goes here
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----
   ```

   Upload the certificate to Mondoo: In the **Drag and drop your .pem file here** box, select the cloud icon and choose the file to upload.

8. To automatically scan all VMs in your subscription, enable **Scan Azure VMs using RunCommand**.

9. Select the **START SCANNING** button.

10. On the Recommended Policies page, enable the policies on which you want to base assessments of your Azure environment. To learn more, read [Manage Policies](/platform/security/posture/policies/).

11. Select **FINALIZE SETUP**.

Mondoo begins scanning your Azure resources. When it completes, you can see results on the INVENTORY page. To learn more, read [Monitor Your Infrastructure Security](/platform/security/posture/monitor/).

If your integration is unsuccessful, read [Troubleshoot an Azure Configuration](/platform/infra/cloud/azure/troubleshoot/).
