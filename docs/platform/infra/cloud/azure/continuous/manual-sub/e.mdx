This is the fifth step in the manual setup for an Azure subscription.

## Step E: Grant permissions to access Azure key vault

:::note

There are two permission models for key vaults: role-based access control (RBAC) and key vault access policy.

See what permission model your key vault uses: In the Azure portal, view the key vault's **Access configuration** settings. (You can easily change it to RBAC.)

:::

If you are using the RBAC for the key vault, there is no need for further actions; the READ permissions on the key vault will be applied by the "Key Vault Reader" subscription permissions applied in Step C.

import Keyvault from "./_include-keyvault.mdx";

<Keyvault />{" "}
