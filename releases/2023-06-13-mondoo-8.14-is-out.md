## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Debian 12 support

In line with the June 10th release of Debian 12 "Bookworm," Mondoo now fully supports Debian 12 operating systems. Mondoo automatically tracks and reports on security advisories for Debian 12 and all official packages, and will report on EOL dates for this release.

### Windows CIS Benchmark Policies updated to version 2.0

Mondoo now supports version 2.0 of the CIS Benchmark for Windows. The CIS benchmarks are prescriptive configuration recommendations for IT systems from the Center for Internet Security (CIS).

The latest Windows CIS Benchmark policies include new security checks as well as improved audit & remediation documentation.
