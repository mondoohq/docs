Each asset that Mondoo scans receives a risk score that summarizes what percentage of the policy's checks the asset fails, weighted by each check’s impact. Risk scores are based on numeric scores between 0 and 100. These are the ranges for Mondoo risk scores:

| From… | To…  | Risk score |                  Description                   |
|:-----:|:----:|:----------:|:----------------------------------------------:|
|   90   | 100  |  CRITICAL  |   Presents extreme risk to your organization   |
|   70   |  89  |    HIGH    | Presents significant risk to your organization |
|   40   |  69  |   MEDIUM   |  Presents moderate risk to your organization   |
|    1   |  39  |    LOW     |   Presents little risk to your organization    |
|    0   |   0  |    NONE    |     Presents no risk to your organization      |

You can control how Mondoo calculates an asset's score on a policy.

## Check impact

An asset's score on a policy is based on the number of checks in the policy that an asset passes and the number that it fails. However, not every check is equal in importance. Every check in a policy has an _impact_ value in one of these four bands:

- Critical

- High

- Medium

- Low

In Mondoo policies, the impact of a check represents the increased vulnerability of an asset that fails the check. For example, the AWS policy check "Ensure Redshift clusters are not publicly accessible" is a critical-impact check because a publicly-accessible cluster is a potential entry point for attack. But "Ensure IAM groups are utilized by assigning at least one user" is a low-impact check because empty IAM groups don't greatly increase an asset's vulnerability.

All Mondoo scoring systems consider check impact when calculating an asset's score.

## Scoring systems

Mondoo has these scoring systems:

- **Banded** strategically uses impact bands to accurately evaluate an asset's security. In this system, the score quickly goes down as the number of critical-impact failures increase. It takes into account other scoring failures (like high and medium), and guarantees a minimum score when an asset has no critical or high failures. For these reasons, Mondoo recommends the banded scoring system to most of our customers.

- **Decayed** scores assets on a curve. As checks fail, this system decreases the score of the asset at a rate proportional to its current value. The decayed scoring system quickly reduces scores as critical findings are added, and doesn't sink scores to zero too quickly as more checks fail. Mondoo recommends decayed scoring to more risk-averse customers.

- **Highest impact** only considers the highest-impact check in the policy. If any check with the highest impact value fails, the asset score is F.

- **Average** simply scores an asset based on the number of passed and failed checks, weighted by each check's impact. This system can give high scores even when multiple critical-impact checks fail. It presents an optimistic view, but doesn't always reflect changes when you fix important issues on an asset.

- **Weighted average** is just like the average scoring system except that it also considers another factor when calculating an asset's score: the weight assigned to a check. This scoring system gives checks with higher weight greater influence over an asset's total score than checks with lower weight.

To learn details about how Mondoo's scoring systems work, read the [Policy Authoring Guide | Score Policies](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/policy-scoring).

## Change a policy's scoring system within a space

Every policy has a default scoring system. The default scoring system is [encoded in the policy](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/policy-scoring). However, you can change which scoring system Mondoo uses for a policy within a [space](/platform/start/organize/spaces).

For example, suppose an Azure policy uses the highest impact scoring system by default, and you find that this system doesn't reflect the improvements you make to the security of assets in your Cloud Operations space. You can change the way that Mondoo scores assets in your Cloud Operations space against that Azure policy: Choose the banded policy scoring instead. Your change doesn't affect the policy's scoring system in other spaces.

To change a policy's scoring system within a space:

import Partial from "../../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the space in which you want to change a policy's scoring system.

2. In the side navigation bar, under **Findings**, select **Policies**.

3. Select the policy you want to customize.

4. At the top of the page, select the scales icon.

   The **Score weighting** control displays.

5. In the **Score by** drop-down list, select the scoring method to use for the policy in the current space.
