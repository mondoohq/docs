## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Simplified policy and query pack management

Say goodbye to the Registry and hello to simplified policy insights and management.

DEETS

### Understand external expose with continuous Shodan scans

Gain visibility into your infrastructure's external exposure with continuous Shodan scanning. Our new Shodan integration allows you to automatically monitor domains, IPs, and even entire IP blocks for external risk.

Paired with our new Shodan security policy and query pack, this scanning provides critical insights into what attackers know about your systems, so you can prioritize essential fixes effectively.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Support non-ASCII characters in space and organization names

We got a bit wrapped up in 'Merica and tossed a few too many bald eagles on the space and organization creation pages. The eagles have been relocated and now you can safely create spaces and organizations with all your favorite non-ASCII characters.
