The work of improving your security posture can be daunting. Mondoo finds security issues in your infrastructure and prioritizes them so you know what problems to fix first. But how do you track the fixes and ensure that the work is completed? How do you communicate the most important tasks to your team?

*Cases* allow you to turn security findings into tasks to complete. They integrate with Atlassian Jira to fit into your existing workflow.

When you see a security finding that requires fixing, you create a case for that finding. Mondoo automatically includes the details of the finding, information on the asset(s) that contain the finding, and instructions for fixing it. When you save the case, Mondoo automatically creates an issue containing all the same information in your Jira project.

Once Mondoo creates an issue directly in Jira, you can schedule remediation work within your team's existing project workflow. Cases let you create Jira issues that include all the details necessary for infrastructure owners to remediate findings, even if they don't have access to Mondoo.

In the Mondoo Console, when a security finding or an asset has a case created for it, you can view the case from the finding or the asset. You can also see a list of all cases in a space.

You can also close cases in the Mondoo Console. A space-wide setting determines whether closing a case in Mondoo closes the corresponding issue in Jira.

## Set up cases to automatically create Jira issues

Set up cases in a space to allow users in the space to add Jira issues from within the Mondoo Console. Cases setup involves configuring Mondoo to integrate with Jira.

### Prerequisites

- Owner or Editor access to the Mondoo space

- A Jira account with access to the project where you want Mondoo to add issues

- An API token for Jira account access

  To learn how to create and copy an API token, read [Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/) in the Atlassian documentation.

### Add a Jira integration

1. In the Mondoo Console, navigate to the space where you want to set up cases and, in the side navigation bar, select **Cases**.

   ![Configure cases in Mondoo](/img/platform/ticket/cases-blank.png)

2. Select the **ADD INTEGRATION** button.

   ![Configure cases in Mondoo](/img/platform/ticket/cases-add-jira.png)

3. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that clearly shows this is a Jira integration.

4. In the **Jira Host** box, type the domain for your Jira instance. Do not include a slash at the end of the domain. Example: `https://lunalectric-workspace.atlassian.net`

5. In the **Email address** box, enter the email address you use to log into your Jira instance.

6. In the **API Token** box, paste your API token for access to your Jira account. To learn how to create and copy an API token, read [Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/) in the Atlassian documentation.

7. By default, when you close a case in the Mondoo Console, Mondoo also closes the corresponding Jira issue. To stop Mondoo from closing Jira issues, disable **Automatically close cases**.

8. Select the **CREATE INTEGRATION** button.

## Create a case to add a Jira issue from Mondoo

When a Mondoo space has the cases feature configured, any team member can create a case, which creates a new a Jira issue directly from the Mondoo Console.

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to a space that is set up to use cases.

2. In the side navigation bar, under **Vulnerabilities**, select **Advisories**.

3. Select the advisory you want to track using a case and a corresponding issue in Jira.

   ![Add a case in Mondoo](/img/platform/ticket/add-case-advisory.png)

4. To the right of the asset name, select the **CREATE CASE** button and select **Selected Assets** to jump to the bottom of the page and see all assets affected by the advisory.

   ![Create a new Jira issue in Mondoo](/img/platform/ticket/select-asset.png)

5. Check the boxes beside all the assets for which you want to track this advisory. Note that this creates a single case (and therefore a single Jira issue) for all the assets you choose. (If you want to track assets separately, create a new case for each asset.)

   Select the **CREATE CASE** button.

   ![Create a new Jira issue in Mondoo](/img/platform/ticket/add-jira-issue.png)

6. Select the Jira project in which you want Mondoo to add the issue. Edit the issue name and description as you wish and select the **CREATE CASE** button.

   Mondoo creates a new case in the space and a corresponding Jira issue in the project you selected.

## View cases and Jira issues

On the Cases page in the Mondoo Console, you can view all the cases in a space.

Select a case to open its corresponding issue in Jira.

![Jira issue created by Mondoo](/img/platform/ticket/issue-in-jira.png)

:::note

Updating a Jira issue that Mondoo created from a case does not make any changes to the case.

:::

## Close a case

Close a case to indicate that the work is completed or to stop tracking it. By default, when you close a case in the Mondoo Console, Mondoo also closes the corresponding Jira issue. However, you can change this when you first set up cases for the space. To learn how, read the "Add a Jira integration" section above.

:::note

Closing an issue in Jira does not close the corresponding case in Mondoo.

:::

1. In the Mondoo Console's side navigation bar, select **Cases**.

   ![Configure cases in Mondoo](/img/platform/ticket/cases-list.png)

2. Select the **CLOSE CASE** button beside on the row of the case you want to close.
