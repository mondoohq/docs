## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Dockerfile Security policy

Secure your container workloads before they're running in production with our new Dockerfile Security policy. With automatic Dockerfile discovery for GitHub and GitLab and this new policy, you can evaluate the security of Dockerfiles no matter where they're hiding. Once you've secured your existing files, keep them secure with Dockerfile scanning in CI pipelines.

### CIS AWS Database Services Benchmark

Keep your most valuable business data secure with the new CIS AWS Database Services benchmark policy. This policy includes security recommendations for Amazon's most popular database services:

- Amazon Aurora
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon ElastiCache
- Amazon Neptune
- Amazon RDS
- Amazon Timestream

### Mondoo Amazon Web Services (AWS) GuardDuty policy

Make the most of AWS GuardDuty with our new Mondoo Amazon Web Services (AWS) GuardDuty policy. This policy includes checks to ensure that GuardDuty is properly enabled and configured for EC2, EKS, IAM, Lambda, and S3 security.

### Mondoo Amazon Web Services (AWS) IAM Access Analyzer

Cloud security starts with securing access to critical resources and now with the Mondoo Amazon Web Services (AWS) IAM Access Analyzer policy you can ensure that IAM Access Analyzer is enabled and properly configured.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) asset category

Quickly evaluate the security of critical IaC code with a new Infrastructure as Code group in the Mondoo Console. This group includes Ansible, AWS Cloudformation, Kubernetes manifests, and Terraform assets under a single category.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Newly certified CIS benchmark policies

Our CIS Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Linux, AlmaLinux, and Rocky Linux 9 policies are better than ever with updates to improve reliability and query output. Even better, these policies are now certified to pass the rigorous CIS benchmark validation process, so you can be confident they'll secure even the most complex enterprise Linux installations.

### Jump right to the point

Now you find what you're looking for with fewer clicks thanks to improved linking behavior on affected assets pages. Links to assets now go directly to the asset result instead of the main asset page, so you can spend your time remediating findings instead of finding them.
