## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Improved risk score display for CVEs

Understand the true risk of CVEs at a glance with a new risk score box on CVE pages. The risk score box includes the overall risk of the CVE as well as the CVSS score, EPSS score, risk factors, and blast radius so you can quickly understand whether a CVE needs attention.

### Updated Windows and Linux CIS benchmark policies

Scan your infrastructure with the very latest CIS benchmark policies for Linux and Windows. These updated policies include improved descriptions, remediation steps, and new checks to keep your systems secure against the latest threats.

- CIS Benchmark RHEL 7 v4.0.0
- CIS Benchmark CentOS 7 v4.0.0
- CIS Benchmark Oracle Linux 7 v4.0.0
- CIS Benchmark Amazon Linux 2 v3.0.0
- CIS Benchmark Windows 2019 v3.0.0
- CIS Benchmark Windows 2022 v3.0.0

### Improved container policy application

From SSH configuration to interactive user permissions, many traditional security checks aren't applicable in a container world. To reduce noise and help you prioritize what matters, CIS benchmarks no longer apply to container workloads. Instead, we've modified our existing Mondoo Linux Security policy to better execute on containers. We highly recommend enabling this policy to scan your containerized workloads.

If you have any suggestions for how we can improve this policy, reach out at [hello@mondoo.com](mailto:hello@mondoo.com).

### Fedora AWS instance snapshot scanning

Scan Fedora workloads in AWS without deploying the Mondoo package. New snapshot scanning support for Fedora instances makes this possible.

### Improved control of SSH policy application

Tune Mondoo's SSH security checks to meet your particular business needs with new reworked SSH checks that include properties. With properties, you can set your allowed SSH key exchange algorithms, ciphers, and message authentication codes (MACs) without the need to write your own checks.

### Validate user account domains in internal Slack channels

Our new `Ensure domain is enforced on internal channels` check lets you make sure all users in your internal channels signed up to Slack using an approved email domain. This check includes a property so you can add one or more allowed domains to ensure that all employees use work email accounts.

### Proxy support for Kubernetes container scans

Running an air-gapped Kubernetes cluster? Don't worry; we've got you covered with new support for scanning workload container images using a proxy server. Update to the 11.2 release of the [Mondoo Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/mondoohq/mondoo-operator) and set your proxy URL in the new `ContainerProxy` configuration option.

### Resource improvements

#### aws.dynamodb.export

- New resource for [Amazon DynamoDB exports to S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/S3DataExport.HowItWorks.html)

#### aws.ssm.parameter

- New resource for parameters in the [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html)

#### docker.file

- New `user` field
