This is the third step in the manual setup for an Azure subscription.

## Step C: Grant required READ permissions to the app

These steps guide you through setting the READ permissions and "Key Vault Reader" permissions for a single subscription. If you want to scan several subscriptions, you must repeat the same steps for each subscription.

If you want Mondoo to monitor an entire management group, you can perform these steps at the management group level: Search for "management groups" in the Azure portal and then select the management group you want to monitor. To monitor the entire directory, select the **tenant root** group.

Set subscription-level permissions for your new app registration:

1. From the Azure portal home, select **Subscriptions**.

2. Select the subscription you want to integrate with Mondoo.

3. In the sidebar under the subscription name, select **Access control (IAM)**.

4. Select the **Add role assignment** button.

5. Select the **Reader** role and then select the Members tab (or Next button).

7. Select the **Review + assign** button (or Next button), check your work, and then select the **Review + assign** button again to assign the Reader role to your Mondoo app registration.

8. Repeat steps 4-7 and this time choose the **"Key Vault Reader"** role in step 5.

   Keep the Access control (IAM) page open as you continue to Step D.
