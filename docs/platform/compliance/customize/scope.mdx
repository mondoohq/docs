If a certain control in a framework is not part of your compliance audit, you can set it _out of scope_. Mondoo excludes out-of-scope controls when calculating your overall progress toward compliance with the framework and when generating your [compliance report](/platform/compliance/monitor/progress/#generate-a-compliance-report).

All controls in a framework are in scope by default. You set a control out of scope for a [space](/platform/start/organize/spaces/). In all other spaces, the control remains in scope.

:::tip

Setting a control out of scope hides it entirely from your auditor. To exclude a control from your compliance score but include it in the report to your auditor with a justification, [disable or snooze the control](/platform/compliance/customize/exceptions/).
