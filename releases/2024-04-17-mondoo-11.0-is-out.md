## üî® BREAKING CHANGES

### End of life for cnspec/cnquery 9.x

With the release of cnspec and cnquery 11.0, we are no longer supporting our legacy 9.x releases. This does not mean your clients will immediately stop working. However, we will start updating policies to use new MQL capabilities introduced in version 10.0. These changes will improve the readability of queries as well as the scan output, but they are not compatible with older clients. If you need assistance with upgrading older clients, please reach out via our [Support form](https://mondoo.com/support).

### New default JSON CLI output

cnspec's `--json` flag now uses our updated `json-2` output format by default. If you rely on the original json output you can still set that with the `--output json-2` flag.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Windows 11 compatibility policy

Enable the new Windows 11 Compatibility policy to see if existing Windows workstations meet the hardware requirements for Windows 11. This policy includes several different checks for CPU, RAM, TPM, and hard drive space requirements. To learn more about these hardware requirements, read Microsoft's [Windows 11 Specs & System Requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications) page.

### CIS Azure Foundations 2.1.0

Mondoo now includes the latest CIS Azure Foundations 2.1.0 benchmarks. This new release of the policy includes 82 total updates including 7 all new checks and the removal of 8 checks that are no longer relevant.

### Console performance improvements

No one wants to wait for web pages to load. That's why we sprinkled some magical optimizations on how the console fetches space and asset data to make sure pages are always snappy to load.

### Updated Mondoo Microsoft Azure Security policy

The Mondoo Microsoft Azure Security policy has been rewritten from the ground up with new and expanded queries that match the latest Azure capabilities including Microsoft's Entra ID.

### Additional organization owner privileges

Organization owners are no longer required to be space owners in order to remove users from a space.

## üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Skip CIS Linux checks for at and cron to skip if packages are not installed.
- Improve query output of CIS at and cron checks using variants.
- Update macOS policy to not fail if OS configuration files are missing.

- Improve the performance of the `aws.cloudtrails.trail` and `aws.ec2.instance` resources.
