## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### New CIS policies for OCI, OpenShift, and Amazon 2023

We've been busy pulling in the latest CIS policies for your growing infrastructure, with five new policies this week to help you secure the latest platforms:

- CIS Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform v4 Benchmark - Level 1
- CIS Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform v4 Benchmark - Level 2
- CIS Amazon 2023 Benchmark - Level 1
- CIS Amazon 2023 Benchmark - Level 2
- CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundation Benchmark - Level 1

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Improved policy formatting

The `cnspec bundle lint` command has seen improvements to better handle multi-line queries. These queries will now automatically format on individual lines so you can more easily read your policies.

Before:

```coffee
mql: "users.where(\n  shell.contains(\"nologin\") == false && shell.contains(\"false\") == false\n  && name != \"sync\" && name != \"shutdown\" && name != \"halt\" \n).list {\n  file(home) {exists}\n}\n"
```

After:

```coffee
mql: |
  users.where(
    shell.contains("nologin") == false && shell.contains("false") == false
    && name != "sync" && name != "shutdown" && name != "halt"
  ).list {
    file(home) {exists}
  }
```

### Improved performance

Who doesn't like getting the same thing, only faster? We optimized how we deliver policy data from Mondoo Platform to our clients to make your scans even quicker. Expect to save around 1.5 seconds on each scan. We hope you make the best of this time windfall.
