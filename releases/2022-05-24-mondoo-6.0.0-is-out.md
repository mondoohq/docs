We have just hit a major milestone - Mondoo‚Äôs 6.0 release! This version includes many changes we‚Äôre eager to share with you:

- [üéâ NEW FEATURES](#-new-features)
  - [CLI scan providers](#cli-scan-providers)
  - [CLI reports overhaul](#cli-reports-overhaul)
  - [Exit codes and score thresholds](#exit-codes-and-score-thresholds)
  - [AWS Organization integration](#aws-organization-integration)
- [üßπ IMPROVEMENTS](#-improvements)
  - [MQL improvements](#mql-improvements)
  - [CI/CD detection](#cicd-detection)
- [üêõ BUGFIXES](#-bugfixes)

Most of these changes have been available hidden behind feature flags and CLI options for a while now. This release changes the default experience to make them available to everyone.

**Is it difficult to upgrade?**

Not at all! We have kept most things backwards-compatible with v5. In most cases you should only see a few deprecation warnings asking you to use new CLI options. The few breaking changes are outlined below.

**Breaking changes**

- `mondoo scan` now uses the exit code 0 whenever the scan is successfully executed. Previously we used non-zero exit codes when a scan didn‚Äôt achieve a perfect score. This change makes it easier to use Mondoo in a CI/CD. See [the section on exit codes] below.
- `mondoo scan` without additional arguments no longer automatically scans your local system. We changed this to prevent you from accidentally scanning your local OS. Run `mondoo scan local` to scan your local system. Check out our new [scan providers] for more targets below.
- The default CLI reporter has changed to `compact` mode, which doesn‚Äôt rely on pagination and prints a much shorter summary. See [CLI reports] for more information.
- When you run `mondoo scan` with a `--policy-bundle`, the option `--incognito` is now used by default instead of printing an error and aborting.

**Deprecations**

All deprecations will be supported throughout the lifetime of Mondoo v6. We will remove them when we release Mondoo v7.

- The `-t` and `--connection` options for `mondoo scan`, `mondoo exec` and `mondoo shell` have been deprecated. Please use [scan providers] instead.
- The `--exit-0-on-success` option has been deprecated and is the new default. Feel free to remove it. See [the section on exit codes].

## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### CLI scan providers

**Problem:** Mondoo can scan many different targets, from your local machine, to remote machines via SSH or WinRM, to cloud systems like AWS or Azure, and even arbitrary APIs. These are specified via the `--connection` or `-t` option in the CLI. Unfortunately, it was difficult to use this option effectively, partly due to the wide range of targets and parameters that were supported.

**Solution:** We are providing a new way to target assets with this release. The `scan` command has changed from:

```
mondoo scan -t <schema>://<options>
mondoo scan --connection <schema>://<options>
```

to

```
mondoo scan <provider>
```

To access a list of all available providers, type:

```
mondoo scan -h
```

```
Usage:
  mondoo scan [flags]
  mondoo scan [command]

Available commands:
  arista      Scan an Arista endpoint
  aws         Scan an AWS account or instance
  azure       Scan a Microsoft Azure account or instance
  container       Scan a container, an image, or a registry
  docker      Scan a Docker container or image
  gcp         Scan a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account
  github      Scan a GitHub organization
  gitlab      Scan a GitLab group
  host        Scan a host endpoint
  k8s         Scan a Kubernetes cluster
  local       Scan a local target
  mock        Scan a mock target (a simulated asset)
  ms365       Scan a Microsoft 365 endpoint
  ssh         Scan a SSH target
  terraform   Scan all Terraform files in a path (.tf files)
  vagrant     Scan a Vagrant host
  vsphere     Scan a VMware vSphere API endpoint
  winrm       Scan a WinRM target
```

You can find more information on every provider with the `-h` or `--help` option. For example:

```bash
mondoo scan container -h
```

Here are a few more examples of `mondoo scan` with different providers:

```bash
mondoo scan local
mondoo scan ssh user@host
mondoo scan container b62b
mondoo scan container image ubuntu:20.04
mondoo scan aws
```

### CLI reports overhaul

**Problem:** The default CLI reports used a lot of screen space to convey their findings. They also printed from top to bottom, with a summary and a lot of information below, which forced us to default to pagination for these reports to avoid scrolling. These reports are helpful for security audits, but they didn‚Äôt help most other CLI users.

**Solution:** We have designed a new report whose primary audience is developers and operations experts. This means that we now print a list of controls and data queries first, then list vulnerabilities, and then finish with a short summary. We deactivated the pagination. The default report is also much more compact:

```bash
mondoo scan local
# OR
mondoo scan local -o compact
```

To get more information about individual controls, use the `full` formatter:

```bash
mondoo scan local -o full
```

Here is an example of compact (left) versus full (right) output side-by-side for the scan scan:

![Mondoo6 Compact vs Full Output](/img/releases/2022-05-24-mondoo-6.0.0-is-out/mondoo6-compact-vs-full.png)

You can access the auditor- and security-centric report via `-o report`. This was the default output before v6.

You can list all output formats:

```bash
mondoo scan -o help
```

```
Available output formats: junit, compact, full, report, json, csv, yaml
```

### Exit codes and score thresholds

**Problem:** Whenever Mondoo scans ran in CI/CD pipes, unless they had perfect scores (an A+ with a score of 100), they finished with a non-zero exit code. This caused the pipeline to fail, even with only minor issues.

We had previously introduced the `--exit-0-on-success` option to address this use case. It changed the behavior to always finish with an exit code of 0 whenever the scan was successful‚Äîeven if it produced an **F**.

While this helped remedy the original problem with failing pipeline runs, it didn‚Äôt help users who wanted to fail their tests if certain conditions were met. This was technically possible, by knowing all the available exit codes `mondoo scan` generated, but was impractical and hard to use.

**Solution:** Mondoo scans now always return an exit code of 0 by default when a scan is successful. Both **A**s and **F**s show a successful run.

With the previously introduced `--score-threshold` you can change this behavior to fail the execution (exit code 1) whenever the score falls too low. For example, this command fails all scans that result in an **F** (if their score is below 10):

```bash
mondoo scan ‚Ä¶ --score-threshold 10
```

### AWS Organization integration

We are excited to release the AWS Organization integration, which allows you to set up AWS integrations across your entire AWS Organization or organizational unit.

![Mondoo6 AWS Organization Integration](/img/releases/2022-05-24-mondoo-6.0.0-is-out/mondoo6-aws-orgs.png)

We previously only supported single account installs. With this change, you can use AWS CloudFormation StackSets to install the integration across all accounts in your AWS Organization and automatically have the integration be installed to all new accounts added to that AWS Organization.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### MQL improvements

**Problem:** It was impossible to use variables across blocks in MQL, which made a lot of queries more difficult to write. We have wanted to fix this issue for a while, which required a major change in MQL‚Äôs execution engine.

**Solution:** Variables can now be used across blocks like you would in many other programming languages. Here is a simple example:

```coffeescript
aws.dynamodb.tables {
  x = region
  aws.dynamodb.
     limits.
     where(region == x) {*}
}
```

In this example, we define a new variable `x` and set its value to the `region` of the table. We can then use the variable to access the limits entry that matches this region. Previously this was not possible, since both fields had the same name (`region`) and variables weren‚Äôt accessible across blocks.

### CI/CD detection

We now automatically detect the client running in CI/CD environments. Once detected, we collect more contextual information about the run, like the repository, PR/MR number, and git reference. This allows CI/CD runs to automatically show up in the **CI/CD** tab in the UI, where you can explore more details.

Today, we support this feature for GitHub, GitLab, and Kubernetes out of the box. We are expanding to other systems soon, so stay tuned!
