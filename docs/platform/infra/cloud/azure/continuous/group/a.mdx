This is the first step in the quick setup for an Azure management group.

## Step A: Retrieve your management group ID

If you want Mondoo to continuously scan all the resources in a management group, retrieve the group's ID in the Azure CLI:

1. Run this command:

```bash
az account management-group list
```

2. Copy the ID of the group you want and paste it somewhere handy to use in later steps.
