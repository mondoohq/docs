## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Azure Container Registry scanning

Mondoo now supports scanning [Azure Container Registries (ACR)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-registry) that require authentication using credentials stored after running the `az login` command.

To login and scan a complete registry run:

```bash
az login
cnspec scan container registry my_registry.azurecr.io
```

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Collect logged-in users in query packs

Windows, Linux, and macOS query packs now collect the currently logged-in users so you can understand active users on endpoints or remote connections to servers.
