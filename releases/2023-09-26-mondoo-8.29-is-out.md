## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Improved UI tables

At Mondoo we take pride in not just collecting security information, but also displaying it in a meaningful way. If you've been using the product long enough you may have noticed we've gone through many iterations of our table view. It never felt quite right, until we introduced the new table in Compliance Hub that lets you easily view, sort, and multi-select data without pull down menus or multiple clicks. This week the team revamped all of our existing views to update them with this improved UX. Give it a try and keep an eye out for pagination improvements coming soon!

### Fleet is now Inventory

When we first built Mondoo, the Fleet view was where you found all of your servers or workstations. As we expanded Mondoo to include Kubernetes workloads, cloud accounts, and even SaaS servers, this name made less sense. This week we renamed Fleet to Inventory to better represent Mondoo's cross-platform asset inventory capabilities. It's just a rename, but we think this will make it easier to jump right in and begin exploring all your inventory.

### Fedora 39 vulnerability scanning

Fedora 39 is right around the corner, with the first beta released this week. Not to be left behind we've added Fedora 39 vulnerability scanning to Mondoo, so fire up cnspec and keep that beta install secure.

### Improved compliance control descriptions

We've expanded the data that can be displayed in Compliance Control pages, so you'll always have all the details to keep your infrastructure secure. This new view includes improved description rendering and the ability to expand extra long descriptions.
