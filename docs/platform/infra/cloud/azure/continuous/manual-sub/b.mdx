This is the second step in the manual setup for an Azure subscription.

## Step B: Grant permissions to access Microsoft Graph (API permissions)

1. In the navigation sidebar, select **API permissions**.

   By default, Microsoft grants your new application `User.Read` permission for Microsoft Graph. It's not required for Mondoo, so you can remove it.

2. Select **+ Add a permission**.

3. From the list of **Commonly used Microsoft APIs**, select **Microsoft Graph**.

4. Because Mondoo acts as a service, select **Application permissions**.

5. Select **expand all** to see all permissions. Then select the required API permissions:
