### Cases & Ticketing Integrations!

Mondoo users can now group security findings into cases, and assign those cases to external ticketing systems for efficient tracking and resolution. Cases ship today with out-of-the-box support for Jira and Zendesk, with more to come.

- Delegate cases to external teams using your existing ticketing systems.
- Automatic issue updates as findings are remediated, ensuring real-time progress tracking.
- Auto-close cases and corresponding tickets when all findings within a case are resolved.
