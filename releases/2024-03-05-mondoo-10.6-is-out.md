## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Filter policies on assets

Asset policy pages now include filtering by policy types and scores so you can see exactly what policies are applied and where failures are occurring.

### Data type conversion MQL helpers

New MQL helpers allow you to quickly convert data to the right format for your custom checks and data queries.

```coffeescript
> int(1.23)
1

> bool(1)
true

> float(12)
12

> string(1.89)
"1.89"

> regex("w.r.d") == "world üåé"
/w.r.d/
```

### Endpoint detection and response (EDR) policy

Ensure critical employee endpoints have endpoint detection and response (EDR) software installed and running with our new Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) policy. This policy checks to see if SentinelOne or CrowdStrike are installed on macOS, Linux, and Windows systems.

### Open source Mondoo documentation

Do typos in documentation keep you up at night like they do for me? We open sourced our documentation so you can fix that problem and get some sleep.

Check out our new public repo at [github.com/mondoohq/docs](https://github.com/mondoohq/docs) for instructions on how to contribute fixes and improvements.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Resource improvements

#### aws.cloudtrail.trails

- Add support for advanced selectors in the `eventSelectors` field.

#### aws.config

- Add new `deliveryChannels` field.

#### aws.config.deliverychannel

- Add a new resource with fields representing an individual AWS Config delivery channel configured within an account.

#### aws.iam.role

- Add new `assumeRolePolicyDocument` field.

#### package

- Add new `originVersion` field on Debian Linux-based assets.
- Include version data in the `origin` field for source packages on Debian Linux-based assets.

### Filter AWS scans by region

Filter cnspec command line scans by AWS region with new filter options:

```bash
cnspec scan aws --filters all:region=us-east-2
cnspec scan aws --filters region=us-east-2
cnspec scan aws --filters ec2:region=us-east-2
```

Thanks for this great contribution [@montera82](https://github.com/montera82/)!

### Updated policy check impact scores

Prioritize the most important checks first with newly adjusted check priorities for CIS Linux distribution policies. These improved scores ensure that only the most important checks are listed as failures, so you can more easily prioritize critical work.

### Improved AWS policies

Both the CIS AWS Foundations benchmark policy and the various AWS Best Practices policies have seen major refactoring. These changes include improved queries and result output as well as new descriptions and remediation data. Stay tuned for more updates as we refactor all queries in these policies to use the latest MQL resources and helpers.
