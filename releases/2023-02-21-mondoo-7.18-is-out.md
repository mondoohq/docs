## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### GCP resource updates

We've continued to expand the data you can query using MQL in your GCP projects to make asset inventory and security easier:

- Add new `gcp.project.compute.addresses` resource

  ```coffeescript
  gcp.project.compute.addresses[0]: {
  ipv6EndpointType: ""
  created: 2022-12-15 12:45:25.62 -0800 -0800
  address: "10.10.0.2"
  network: data is not a map to auto-expand
  networkTier: "PREMIUM"
  id: "2700460578865297802"
  userUrls: [
      0: "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/mondoo-edge/regions/us-central1/forwardingRules/gke-mondoo-gke-cluster-2-c255f8bc-73b71c8f-pe"
  ]
  ipVersion: ""
  name: "gke-mondoo-gke-cluster-2-c255f8bc-73b71c8f-pe"
  status: "IN_USE"
  subnetworkUrl: "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/mondoo-edge/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/mondoo-gke-cluster-2-subnet"
  prefixLength: 0
  networkUrl: ""
  regionUrl: "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/mondoo-edge/regions/us-central1"
  addressType: "INTERNAL"
  purpose: "GCE_ENDPOINT"
  description: ""
  subnetwork: gcp.project.computeService.subnetwork name="mondoo-gke-cluster-2-subnet"
  }
  ```

- Add new `gcp.project.compute.forwardingRules` resource

  ```coffeescript
  gcp.project.compute.forwardingRules: [
  0: {
      description: ""
      ipProtocol: "TCP"
      serviceDirectoryRegistrations: []
      id: "1374403102344"
      labels: {}
      name: "front-lb-1-test"
      serviceName: ""
      network: gcp.project.computeService.network name="test-vpc-3"
      networkUrl: "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/manuel-development-2/global/networks/test-vpc-3"
      allPorts: false
      targetUrl: "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/manuel-development-2/regions/us-central1/targetHttpProxies/lb-1-test-target-proxy"
      ipAddress: "35.209.226.183"
      allowGlobalAccess: false
      networkTier: "STANDARD"
      backendService: ""
      isMirroringCollector: false
      subnetwork: data is not a map to auto-expand
      noAutomateDnsZone: false
      serviceLabel: ""
      ports: []
      loadBalancingScheme: "EXTERNAL_MANAGED"
      ipVersion: ""
      created: 2023-01-19 10:56:30.873 -0800 -0800
      metadataFilters: []
      regionUrl: "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/manuel-development-2/regions/us-central1"
      portRange: "80-80"
      subnetworkUrl: ""
  }
  ]
  ```

- `gcp.project.dataproc.clusters` data is now only gathered if if the DataProc Cloud service is enabled in the project.
- Improve reliability of parsing GCP alert policies conditions.

### New and improved EOL detection

We've improved support for detecting end of life (EOL) platforms with new and updates EOL detection support:

- Added EOL detection support for FreeBSD.
- Added EOL detection support for Linux Mint.
- Added EOL date for Alpine 3.17.
- Added EOL date for Fedora 36 and 37.
- Updated Debian EOL dates to use the end of LTS dates.
- Updated Photon 2.0 EOL date for the revised date of Dec 31, 2022.
- Updated Amazon 2022 EOL date for the revised date of Nov 1, 2027.

### Support storing Okta token in `OKTA_CLIENT_TOKEN` env var

If you don't want to pass your Okta token on the CLI with the `--token` flag, cnquery and cnspec now support fetching the token from the `OKTA_CLIENT_TOKEN` env var in your shell.

## üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Improve consistency of the icons in each integrations page and ensure they are all using the latest vendor logos.
- Allow opening assets in the fleet view in new windows.
- Don't show advisories with 0 impacted assets on the space overview page if there are no advisories for any assets in the space.
