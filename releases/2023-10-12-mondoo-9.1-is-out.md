## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Continuous scanning of hosted GitLab instances

Running your own private GitLab instance? No problem. Now Mondoo can continuously scan your private GitLab instances, automatically discovering sub-groups, projects, and even IaC code in projects.

### New and expanded Azure/M365 resources

New resources and fields expand the ability to secure and inventory your Microsoft cloud assets with Mondoo. We've exposed critical networking information in Azure as well as service principal and enterprise application data in Azure AD (now Microsoft Entra ID), giving you the data you need for custom security policies or compliance audits.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Expanded AWS resource fields

We're back again this week with 25 new AWS resource fields, giving you the information you need to inventory and secure your assets:

#### aws.ec2.instance

- `vpcArn`: The ARN of the VPC associated with the instance

#### aws.efs.filesystem

- `availabilityZone`: Availability zone where the file system exists if a specific AZ is defined
- `createdAt`: Creation timestamp

#### aws.es.domains

- `elasticsearchVersion`: The version of Elasticsearch running
- `domainId`: The Elasticsearch domain ID
- `domainName`: The Elasticsearch domain name

#### aws.secretsmanager.secrets

- `createdAt`: Creation date of the secret
- `description`: Description of the secret
- `lastChangedDate`: The last date the secret was changed
- `lastRotatedDate`: The last date the secret was automatically rotated
- `nextRotationDate`: The date of the next secret rotation
- `primaryRegion`: The primary region of the secret
- `rotationEnabled`: Whether rotation is enabled for the secret

#### aws.redshift.clusters

- `availabilityZone`: Availability zone where the cluster exists
- `clusterRevisionNumber`: Specific revision number of the database in the cluster
- `clusterStatus`: Current state of this cluster. Values: available, creating, deleting, rebooting, renaming, and resizing
- `clusterSubnetGroupName`: Name of the subnet group that is associated with the cluster
- `clusterVersion`: Version of the Redshift engine running on the cluster
- `createdAt`: Cluster creation timestamp
- `dbName`: Name of the initial database that was created when the cluster was created
- `enhancedVpcRouting`: Whether enhanced VPC routing is enabled for the cluster traffic
- `masterUsername`: Master user name for the cluster
- `nextMaintenanceWindowStartTime`: The next scheduled maintenance window
- `numberOfNodes`: The number of nodes in the cluster
- `vpcId`: The ID of the VPC where the cluster is running

### New `related` property in `terraform.block` resource

Discover all resources related to a given Terraform resource.

For example, given the following Terraform snippet:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "dev-resources-iam-role" {
  name        = "SSM-role-${local.name}-${random_string.suffix.result}"
  # ...
}

resource "aws_iam_instance_profile" "dev-resources-iam-profile" {
  name = "ec2_ssm_profile-${local.name}-${random_string.suffix.result}"
  role = aws_iam_role.dev-resources-iam-role.name
  # ...
}
```

Using this MQL:

```coffeescript
terraform.resources {
  nameLabel
  related {
    nameLabel
  }
}
```

We get:

```coffeescript
terraform.resources: [
  0: {
    nameLabel: "aws_iam_instance_profile"
    related: [
      0: {
        nameLabel: "aws_iam_role"
      }
    ]
  }
  1: {
    nameLabel: "aws_iam_role"
    related: [
      0: {
        nameLabel: "aws_iam_instance_profile"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Improved results pagination

The larger your infrastructure, the larger the results of your security scans. Now it's easier to navigate those large results no matter where you are in the Mondoo Console. We've reworked our results pagination to make it more consistent and to allow you show more results per page when you need to view those extra large data sets.

### Expanded openSUSE Linux CVE data

Mondoo now includes data on CVEs in openSUSE Linux 15.2 through the latest 15.6 pre-releases.
