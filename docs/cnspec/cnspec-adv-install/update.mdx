cnspec is a versioned binary. To identify the currently installed version of cnspec, run:

```
cnspec version
```

To learn about cnspec provider versioning, read [Manage cnspec Providers](/cnspec/cnspec-adv-install/providers/).

## How cnspec versioning works

Mondoo's versioning policy is _based on_ the semantic versioning standard. For example, in version 6.3.2, 6 is the major version, 3 is the minor version, and 2 is the patch. When we release a new version, we increment one of these three version components depending on the type of changes we introduce.

### Breaking changes policy

Major version releases of cnspec contain _soft-breaking_ changes. These may require you to update your policies, or automation scripts in order to avoid disruption, but you have a long time to make those updates. We provide advanced warning before we make these changes, and they don't become _hard-breaking_ changes until the next major release.

## Update cnspec

To update cnspec to the latest version, you can use your preferred package manager, such as Homebrew or Chocolatey, or simply re-run the installation script.

:::tip

Integrations that run on Mondoo Platform as well as the Kubernetes operator and the AWS Lambda-based integration, automatically update to the latest version; there's no need to manually update.
