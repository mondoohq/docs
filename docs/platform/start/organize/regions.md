Privately hosted Enterprise accounts run in a single region.

![Regions](/img/platform/start/regions.png)

Mondoo operates in different regions so that you can follow localized policy requirements (such as GDPR). Each of the [organizations](organizations.md) and [spaces](spaces.md) in your Mondoo account exists within one region. Currently Mondoo supports two regions:

- **US** operates in the United States of America.
- **EU** operates in the European Union.

In a single Mondoo account, you can have some organizations in the US region and others in the EU region. All of the data stored and processing performed in the two regions are completely separate. You can't move assets between the two regions, nor can you share data between the two in any way.

:::note

Even if you don't have region-specific requirements, you can choose to operate in the region where you're located just for faster response times.
:::

When you first create a Mondoo account, the US region is enabled by default; all assets you create are in the US region.

### Enable the EU region

If you want to create assets in the EU region, you must first enable it.

1. In the top-left corner of the Mondoo window, select the globe drop-down list to show the region options.
2. Select EU.
3. Select Enable.

You can now [add an organization](organizations.md) in the EU region.

### Switch between regions

You can view only one region at a time.

To switch between regions:

1. In the top-left corner of the Mondoo window, select the globe drop-down list.
2. Select the region you want to view.
