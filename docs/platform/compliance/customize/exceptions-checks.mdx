description: Set exceptions for checks within a compliance framework control to customize how Mondoo evaluates your compliance with that framework

---

_Exceptions_ let you customize how Mondoo evaluates your compliance with a framework and communicate the reasons for that customization.

Exceptions tell Mondoo to exclude certain [checks](/platform/compliance/monitor/frameworks/) when calculating your progress toward full compliance. There are two types of exceptions for checks:

- _Risk Acceptance_: Temporarily exclude check results from your overall compliance progress percentage. Risk acceptance is useful when you intend to comply with a control eventually but don't want it distracting your team right now. You can write a note justifying the delay to your team and your auditor.

- _Disable_ Permanently exclude a check from your compliance score and explain this exclusion to team. A control remains disabled unless you re-enable it.

:::info

When you set an exception on a check, you set that exception for the entire space. A check exception applies to the policy containing the check and impacts all compliance frameworks that use the check.

To learn about frameworks, policies, controls, and checks, read [Enable Compliance Frameworks](/platform/compliance/monitor/frameworks/).

You can also set exceptions for an entire control in a Framework. To learn more, read [Set Exceptions on Controls](/platform/compliance/customize/exceptions/).

## Approve or reject an exception

<Partial />{" "}

Exceptions take effect the moment they're added. However, as an extra tracking step, a team member can approve or reject an exception:

- Approving an exception allows it to remain.

- Rejecting an exception removes it and re-enables the check.

To approve or reject an exception:

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the space you want to work in.

2. In the side navigation bar, select **Compliance**.
