cnspec assesses your Linux assets for misconfigurations that put your organization at risk. You can evaluate a Linux asset for compliance with security policies created by Mondoo or the community, or [create your own policies](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/). You also can write individual tests to run on the fly or include in automated tasks.

For a list of Linux resources you can test, read [Mondoo Operating Systems (OS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/os-pack/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core-pack/).

## Requirements

To test a Linux asset with cnspec, you must have:

- [cnspec installed on your workstation](/cnspec/)
- Access to the asset

## Assess Linux security with policy-based scanning

The Linux Security by Mondoo policy is available to all in Mondoo's [cnspec-policies GitHub repo](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec-policies/tree/main/core). This collection of tests evaluates how well your environment follows fundamental Linux security best practices.

To scan a local machine using the Linux Security by Mondoo policy, run:

```bash
cnspec scan
```

To scan a remote machine using the Linux Security by Mondoo policy, run:

```bash
cnspec scan ssh user@HOST
```

For `HOST`, substitute the hostname of the remote Linux asset.

cnspec finds the default policy for Linux and runs a scan based on that policy. It returns a report summarizing the scan results.

To learn more about the command, read [cnspec scan](/cnspec/cli/cnspec_scan/).

You can also create your own policies to meet your specific needs. To learn more about policies, read [Policies](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/).

## Learn more

cnspec also provides an interactive shell in which you can explore. It helps you understand the checks that cnspec policies use, and write your own as well. It's also a great way to interact with both local and remote targets on the fly. To learn more, read [Create Checks in cnspec Shell](/cnspec/cnspec-scan/).

- To learn more about how the MQL query language works, read [Write Effective MQL](/mql/mql.write/).

- For a list of all the operating system resources and fields you can query, read the [Mondoo Operating Systems (OS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/os-pack/).

- To learn about cnspec commands, read:

  - [cnspec scan](/cnspec/cli/cnspec_scan/)
