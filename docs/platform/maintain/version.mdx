description: Learn about Mondoo's versioning policy and how to make sure you have the latest release
---

Mondoo Platform is web-based SaaS, so you never need to upgrade to get the latest Mondoo Console and administrative software. However, [cnspec](/platform/infra/opsys/mondoo-cnspec/), Mondoo's CLI that powers some Mondoo integrations, is a binary that you manage on your assets.

:::note

You're responsible for updating cnspec across your infrastructure. To learn how, read [Update cnspec](/cnspec/cnspec-adv-install/update/).

## How Mondoo versioning works

Mondoo's versioning policy is _based on_ the semantic versioning standard. For example, in version 6.3.2, 6 is the major version, 3 is the minor version, and 2 is the patch. When we release a new version, we increment one of these three version components depending on the type of changes we introduce.

### Breaking changes

Major version releases of Mondoo contain _soft-breaking_ changes. These may require you to update your integrations, policies, or automation scripts in order to avoid disruption, but you have a long time to make those updates. We provide advanced warning before we make these changes, and they don't become _hard-breaking_ changes until the next major release.

### Supported releases

cnspec follows an N-1 support cycle, meaning the current version (N) and the immediate previous version (N-1) are officially supported. During this time, both major versions can communicate with the Mondoo Platform and execute all published policies and query packs. For example, if the current release of cnspec is 11.37, the Mondoo Platform supports all versions from 10.0 through 11.37. When cnspec 12.0 is released, the minimum supported version will become 11.0, and all earlier 10.x releases will reach end of life (EOL).
