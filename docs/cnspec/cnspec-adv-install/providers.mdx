cnspec can assess the security of dozens of different platforms, from AWS to Windows hosts. _Providers_ are the components of cnspec that allow it to evaluate specific platforms. When you download and install cnspec, you don't download or install any providers. Instead, when you run a cnspec command, cnspec automatically downloads and installs the provider(s) you need. This approach saves you download time, memory, and disk space. Each time you use cnspec, it ensures that you have the latest version of the necessary provider(s).

For example, suppose you download cnspec and install it on a Linux workstation. There are no providers installed on the workstation. When you run `cnspec scan` to assess local security, cnspec checks and finds that the provider it needs, the operating systems (`os`) provider isn't present. cnspec automatically downloads and installs the `os` provider and then runs the scan. The `os` provider remains on your workstation for the next time you use cnspec for your operating system.

Continuing the example, suppose you then run `cnspec shell aws` to run some checks against your AWS account settings. cnspec downloads and installs the `aws` provider and opens the shell. The `aws` provider remains on your workstation for the next time you use cnspec for AWS.

Most users don't need to think about providers. cnspec manages them for you. However, there are some situations where you might want to manage providers yourself:

- Containers

- Read-only mode

- Air-gapped environments

## Provider considerations for containers

By default, when you spin up a container with cnspec installed and run any cnspec command, cnspec retrieves the latest version of the providers it needs. When the container is destroyed, the providers are destroyed. Therefore, the next time you spin up a container based on the same image, the download and installation repeat.

You can eliminate the unnecessary processing by:

- Installing the provider(s) on the image. To learn how, read [Install, update, and remove providers](#install-update-and-remove-providers) below.

- Turning off provider auto-update. To learn how, read [Turn off provider auto-update](#turn-off-provider-auto-update) below.

## Provider considerations for read-only mode

Some security situations dictate that cnspec must not be allowed to write to the machine on which it's installed. cnspec does operate in read-only mode, however, it can't download and install the providers it needs. Therefore, when you install cnspec on a machine on which cnspec won't have write access, you must also install the provider. To learn how, read [Install, update, and remove providers](#install-update-and-remove-providers) below.

:::note

If you install cnspec in an environment where it can't automatically update providers, you're responsible for installing provider updates.

:::

To prevent error messages from displaying when you run commands in read-only mode, turn off provider auto-update. To learn how, read [Turn off provider auto-update](#turn-off-provider-auto-update) below.

## Provider considerations air-gapped environments

In an air-gapped environment, cnspec can't download the providers needed to scan or test the system. Therefore, when you install cnspec to an air-gapped machine, you must also install the provider. To learn how, read [Install, update, and remove providers](#install-update-and-remove-providers) below.

:::note

If you install cnspec in an air-gapped environment, you're responsible for installing provider updates.

:::

To prevent error messages from displaying when you run commands, turn off provider auto-update.

## Turn off provider auto-update

By default, each time you run a cnspec command, cnspec downloads and installs the latest version of the provider needed to execute the command (unless the latest version of the provider is already installed). You can change this behavior by disabling auto-update for cnspec.

If you disable auto-update, cnspec doesn't check whether the latest version of the necessary provider is installed. It uses the version of the necessary provider that is currently installed. If the provider isn't installed, the command fails.

### Turn off provider auto-update for all cnspec commands and Mondoo scans

To never automatically update providers, set the auto-update value in the cnspec configuration file to `false`.

On a Linux or macOS host, cnspec configuration is stored in one of these locations:

- `/etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml` configures cnspec for all user accounts.

- `~/.config/mondoo/mondoo.yml` configures cnspec for a single user.

On a Windows host, cnspec configuration is stored in one of these locations:

- `C:\ProgramData\mondoo\mondoo.yml` configures cnspec for all users.

- `C:\Users\{username}\.config\mondoo\mondoo.yml` configures cnspec for a single user.

To configure cnspec to never update providers, set the configuration:

```yaml
auto-update: false
```

:::note

If you disable auto-update, be sure to check regularly for new versions of providers. To learn more, read [Install, update, and remove providers](#install-update-and-remove-providers) below.

:::

### Turn provider auto-update on or off for a single cnspec command

To skip checking for, downloading, and installing the latest provider just once (for a single cnspec command), add the '--auto-update=false' flag to the command. For example, this scans the local machine without updating to the latest provider:

```bash
cnspec scan --auto-update=false
```

The command line flag overrides the `mondoo.yml` config file setting.

## Install, update, and remove providers

You can download the latest versions of providers at [https://releases.mondoo.com/providers/](https://releases.mondoo.com/providers/). Past versions are always available at the same location.
