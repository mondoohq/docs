The **Top Actions** list is your prioritized remediation plan, curated by Mondoo. It cuts through the noise of thousands of findings to show you exactly where to focus your efforts for maximum security impact.

### What are Top Actions?

Top Actions is a list of the 30 vulnerabilities across your environment that have the highest **Risk Reduction** value. These are the issues that, when fixed, will most significantly improve your overall Space Risk Score.

You can find the Top Actions list directly on the **Security Overview** page in the Mondoo Console.

### How to Use the Top Actions List

Your workflow for using Top Actions is simple and effective:

1.  **Navigate to the Security Overview:** This is your main dashboard for understanding your security posture.
2.  **Locate the Top Actions Panel:** The list is prominently displayed, sorted with the highest-impact finding at the top.
3.  **Analyze the Top Item:** Look at the first finding on the list.
    * **Risk Reduction:** This number tells you the precise impact this fix will have.
    * **Effort:** Compare the "Industry Standard Effort" with the "Mondoo Automated Effort" to understand the complexity and potential time savings.
4.  **Identify Quick Wins:** Scan the list for findings with high Risk Reduction but low Mondoo Automated Effort. These are your quick winsâ€”remediations that deliver a huge security return for minimal effort.
5.  **Plan Your Remediation:** Use this data to assign tasks, plan sprints, and justify resource allocation.

By consistently working down your Top Actions list, you ensure that your team is always focused on the most critical security tasks.
