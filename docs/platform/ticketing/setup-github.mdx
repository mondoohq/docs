Set up ticketing in a space to allow users in the space to keep track of security tasks and add GitHub issues directly from within the Mondoo Console. Ticketing setup involves configuring Mondoo to integrate with GitHub.

For an overview of ticketing, read [Track and Fix Findings with Ticketing](/platform/ticketing/overview/).

## Prerequisites

- Owner or Editor access to the Mondoo space

- A GitHub account with access to the project where you want Mondoo to add issues

- Access to a GitHub organization or repository

## Create a GitHub personal access token to give Mondoo access to the repository

A _personal access token_ gives Mondoo the ability to create GitHub issues on your behalf. A token can grant access to an entire GitHub organization or only to specific repositories. Once
you share the token with Mondoo, any new tickets created in the [space](/platform/start/organize/spaces/) can write new GitHub issues using that token.

To learn more about personal access tokens, read [Managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) in the GitHub documentation.

1. Log into GitHub. If you haven't verified your email address with GitHub, do that now.

2. In the upper-right corner of any GitHub page, select your profile photo and then select Settings.

3. In the left sidebar, select **Developer settings**.

4. In the left sidebar, under **Personal access tokens**, select **Fine-grained tokens**.

5. Near the top-right corner of the page, select the **Generate new token** button.

6. In the **Token name** box, enter an easily identifiable name, such as `Mondoo ticketing integration`.

7. In the **Resource owner** drop-down list, select the organization that owns the repository or repositories where you want Mondoo to create issues.

8. In the **Expiration** drop-down list, select the number of days before the token expires. (Be sure to note the expiration date so that, as it approaches, you can create a new one without interrupting the Mondoo-GitHub integration.)

9. Under **Repository access**, select **All repositories** to give Mondoo access to all the repositories in the chosen organization, or select **Only select repositories** and add the repositories you want to give Mondoo access to.

10. Select **Repository permissions** and, in the **Issues** drop-down list, select **Read and write**.

11. Select the **Generate token** button.

12. Copy the token that GitHub generates. You need it in the next steps.

:::note

If your GitHub organization requires approval for personal access tokens, Mondoo can't use your token until a GitHub organization administrator approves the token.

:::tip

If you prefer, you can create a classic personal access token. Assign the `repo` scope to the classic token. To learn more, read [Creating a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) in the GitHub documentation.

3. Select **GitHub Issues**.

4. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that clearly shows this is a GitHub integration.

5. If you have a GitHub Enterprise account, in the **Provide GitHub Enterprise URL** box, type the URL for the account. This is the URL you use to access the home page for your GitHub account. An example is `https://github.mycompany.com`.

6. In the **Provide your personal access token** box, paste the token you copied from GitHub in the steps above.

7. To close a ticket in Mondoo when the corresponding GitHub issue closes, enable **Automatically close tickets**.

8. To create a Mondoo ticket and a corresponding GitHub issue when an asset becomes more exposed to attack, enable **Create drift issues in this integration** and enter the GitHub organization and repository where you want to create new issues. To learn more, read [Automatically create tickets on drift](/platform/ticketing/manage#automatically-create-tickets-on-drift).

9. Select the **CREATE INTEGRATION** button.
