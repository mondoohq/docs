Set up cases in a space to allow users in the space to add Jira issues from within the Mondoo Console. Cases setup involves configuring Mondoo to integrate with Jira.

For an overview of cases, read [Track and Fix Findings with Cases and Jira](/platform/cases/overview/).

## Prerequisites

- Owner or Editor access to the Mondoo space

- A Jira account with access to the project where you want Mondoo to add issues

- An API token for Jira account access

  To learn how to create and copy an API token, read [Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/) in the Atlassian documentation.

## Add a Jira integration

1. In the Mondoo Console, navigate to the space where you want to set up cases and, in the side navigation bar, select **Cases**.

2. Select the **ADD INTEGRATION** button.

3. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that clearly shows this is a Jira integration.

4. In the **Jira Host** box, type the domain for your Jira instance. Do not include a slash at the end of the domain. Example: `https://lunalectric-workspace.atlassian.net`

5. In the **Email address** box, enter the email address you use to log into your Jira instance.

6. In the **API Token** box, paste your API token for access to your Jira account. To learn how to create and copy an API token, read [Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/) in the Atlassian documentation.

7. By default, when you close a case in the Mondoo Console, Mondoo also closes the corresponding Jira issue. To stop Mondoo from closing Jira issues, disable **Automatically close cases**.

8. Select the **CREATE INTEGRATION** button.
