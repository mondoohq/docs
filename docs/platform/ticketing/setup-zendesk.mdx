Set up ticketing in a space to allow users in the space to keep track of security tasks and add Zendesk tickets directly from within the Mondoo Console. Ticketing setup involves configuring Mondoo to integrate with Zendesk.

For an overview of ticketing, read [Track and Fix Findings with Ticketing](/platform/ticketing/overview/).

:::note

Mondoo offers an alternative method for sharing tickets with Zendesk: an email integration. This approach lets you tap into the automation features of [Zendesk email channel](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/5437005103002-Setting-up-your-email-channel). To learn how to create an email integration for ticketing, read [Set up Ticketing to Email Your External Ticket System](/platform/ticketing/setup-email).

:::

## Prerequisites

- Owner or Editor access to the Mondoo space

- A Zendesk account with access to the channel where you want Mondoo to add tickets

- An API token for Zendesk account access

  To learn how to create and copy an API token, read [Managing API token access to the API](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408889192858-Managing-access-to-the-Zendesk-API#topic_tcb_fk1_2yb) in the Atlassian documentation.

## Add a Zendesk integration

4. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that clearly shows this is a Zendesk integration.

5. In the **Zendesk domain** box, your Zendesk subdomain. This is the custom part of the URL you use to access Zendesk. For example, if your Zendesk URL is `lunalectric.zendesk.com` then enter `lunalectric` in this box.

6. In the **Email address** box, enter the email address you use to log into your Zendesk instance.

7. In the **API Token** box, paste your API token for access to your Zendesk account. To learn how to create and copy an API token, read [Managing API token access to the API](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408889192858-Managing-access-to-the-Zendesk-API#topic_tcb_fk1_2yb) in the Atlassian documentation.

8. Select the **CREATE INTEGRATION** button.

9. Some Zendesk instances have custom fields that must be provided for each ticket. To learn about custom fields, read [Using custom fields](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4420210121114-Using-custom-fields) in Zendesk help.

   If your Zendesk instance has required custom fields, enter the field name and a value for all tickets Mondoo creates. To add more custom fields, select the plus sign (+).

10. To close a ticket in Mondoo when the corresponding Zendesk ticket closes, enable **Automatically close tickets**.

11. To create a Mondoo ticket and a corresponding Zendesk ticket when an asset becomes more exposed to attack, enable **Create drift issues in this integration**. To learn more, read [Automatically create tickets on drift](/platform/ticketing/manage#automatically-create-tickets-on-drift).

12. Select the **FINALIZE UPDATE** button.
