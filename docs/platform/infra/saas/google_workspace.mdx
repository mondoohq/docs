The Mondoo Google Workspace integration lets you continuously scan your Google Workspace resources, such as users and applications. It finds misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that put your organization at risk. You deploy the integration once and always get the latest security assessments for new accounts and resources.

import Partial from "./_google-workspace-inc.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

## Add a new Google Workspace integration

In this last step, you configure hosted scanning for Google Workspace.

import Partial2 from "../../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial2 />{" "}

1. Access the Integrations > Add > Google Workspace page in one of two ways:

   - New space setup: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **Google Workspace**.

   - INTEGRATIONS page: In the side navigation bar, under **INTEGRATIONS**, select **Add New Integration**. Under SaaS, select **Google Workspace**.

2. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that lets you easily recognize the Google Workspace account.

3. In the **Mandated user's email** box, enter the email address of a Google Workspace user with super admin access. Mondoo relies on this user's privileges to access the information it needs. You can choose an existing super admin or create one just for Mondoo.

4. Under **Provide your Google Service Account config**, upload the GCP service account's JSON key that you downloaded in the previous section:

   Drag the file and drop it in the **Drag and drop your .json file here** box.

   OR

   In the **Drag and drop your .json file here** box, select the cloud icon and choose the file to upload.

5. To complete the integration, select the **START SCANNING** button.

6. On the Recommended Policies page, enable the policies on which you want to base assessments of your Google Workspace environment. To learn more, read [Manage Policies](/platform/security/posture/policies/).

   Mondoo begins scanning the assets in your Google Workspace and, when completed, presents the results on the INVENTORY page.
