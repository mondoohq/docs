Set up cases in a space to allow users in the space to add Jira issues from within the Mondoo Console. Cases setup involves configuring Mondoo to integrate with Jira.

For an overview of cases, read [Track and Fix Findings with Cases and Jira](/platform/cases/overview/).

## Prerequisites

- Owner or Editor access to the Mondoo space

- A Jira account with access to the project where you want Mondoo to add issues

- An API token for Jira account access

  To learn how to create and copy an API token, read [Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/) in the Atlassian documentation.

## Add a Jira integration

1. In the Mondoo Console, navigate to the space where you want to set up cases and, in the side navigation bar, select **Cases**.

2. Select the **ADD INTEGRATION** button.

3. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that clearly shows this is a Jira integration.

4. In the **Jira host** box, type the domain for your Jira instance. Do not include a slash at the end of the domain. Example: `https://lunalectric-workspace.atlassian.net`

5. In the **Email address** box, enter the email address you use to log into your Jira instance.

6. In the **API token** box, paste your API token for access to your Jira account. To learn how to create and copy an API token, read [Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/) in the Atlassian documentation.

7. Select the **CREATE INTEGRATION** button.

8. Set preferences for how cases work in the space:

   - To close the corresponding Jira issue when you close a case in Mondoo, enable **Automatically close tickets**.

   - To create a corresponding Jira issue when you create a case in Mondoo, enable **Automatically create tickets for cases** and select a default Jira project in which to add new issues. (You can choose a different project each time you add a case.)

9. Select the **FINALIZE UPDATE** button.

## Modify configuration of cases for a space

At any time, you can change how cases work in a space. You can choose a different default Jira project or change whether to automatically create or close Jira issues.

1. In the Mondoo Console, navigate to the space where you want to reconfigure cases.

2. In the side navigation bar, select **Settings**.

3. Select the **Cases** tab.

4. Set preferences for how cases work in the space:

   - To close the corresponding Jira issue when you close a case in Mondoo, enable **Automatically close tickets**.

   - To create a corresponding Jira issue when you create a case in Mondoo, enable **Automatically create tickets for cases** and select a default Jira project in which to add new issues. (You can choose a different project each time you add a case.)

   Mondoo saves changes as you make them.
