## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Cloud resource discovery by default

Gain deeper visibility and control over your cloud environments with enhanced resource discovery by default. Command line scans now automatically enumerate individual cloud resources, matching the comprehensive asset discovery previously exclusive to platform integrations. Instead of seeing a single asset for your cloud account, you now get detailed insights into each resource, making it easier to pinpoint issues, create precise exceptions, and accelerate remediation with clearer query results.

### Simplified command line output

Focus on what matters with simpler command line output by default. cnspec now skips data queries and compliance framework results by default so you can focus on vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Output now also uses the same 0-100 scoring threshold displayed in the console, so results match no matter where you view your scans.

### Improved Terraform resource querying

This update streamlines how you query Terraform resources, making it easier to access the data you need. Instead of complex filtering, you can now directly reference resources by type or name, reducing query complexity and improving readability.

For example with this simple HCL file:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example-1" {
  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example-2" {
  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

You can now find the right resources with simpler one line queries:

```coffee
# return all the "aws_instance" resources:
terraform.resources("aws_instance")

# return a specific resource by name:
terraform.resources("aws_instance", "example-1")

# return resources via a regular expression:
terraform.resources(/aws_/)

# return resources by type and name with a combination of strings and regular expressions:
terraform.resources("aws_instance", /example-[0-9]+/)
```

### Network discovery provider

Automatically discover and scan all your subdomains with the new `networkdiscovery` provider for cnspec.

```shell
$ cnspec scan networkdiscovery example.com --discover subdomains
→ using service account credentials
→ discover related assets for 1 asset(s)

## 🔨 BREAKING CHANGES

We've taken the opportunity in this major release to remove many deprecated MQL resources and fields. If you're using out of the box Mondoo, CSI, or BSI policies don't worry as we've fully updated all content for the latest capabilities. If you're writing your own custom policies you may need to make minor adjustments for compatibility with version 12.0 and later.

- `aws.account.id` now returns only account number instead of `aws.account/1234`
- `aws.elasticache.clusters` replaced with `aws.elasticache.cacheClusters`
- `aws.guardduty.detector.unarchivedFindings` replaced with `aws.guardduty.detector.findings`
- `aws.iam.group.createDate` replaced with `aws.iam.group.createdAt`
- `aws.iam.instanceProfile.createDate` replaced with `aws.iam.instanceProfile.createdAt`
- `aws.iam.policy.createDate` replaced with `aws.iam.policy.createdAt`
- `aws.iam.policy.createDate` replaced with `aws.iam.policy.createdAt`
- `aws.iam.policy.id` replaced with `aws.iam.policy.policyId`
- `aws.iam.policy.updateDate` replaced with `aws.iam.policy.updatedAt`
- `aws.iam.role.createDate` replaced with `aws.iam.role.createdAt`
- `aws.iam.user.createDate` replaced with `aws.iam.user.createdAt`
- `aws.iam.usercredentialreportentry.userCreationTime` replaced with `aws.iam.usercredentialreportentry.createdAt`
- `aws.rds.dbClusters` replaced with `aws.rds.clusters`
- `aws.rds.dbInstances` replaced with `aws.rds.instances`
- `aws.vpc.peeringConnection.peeringVpc.allowEgressFromLocalClassicLinkToRemoteVpc` removed due to the removal of classic EC2 networking
- `aws.vpc.peeringConnection.peeringVpc.allowEgressFromLocalVpcToRemoteClassicLink` removed due to the removal of classic EC2 networking
- `azure.subscription.authorization` replaced with `azure.subscription.iam`
- `azure.subscription.authorizationService.roleDefinition.isCustom` replaced with `azure.subscription.authorizationService.roleDefinition.type`
- `azure.subscription.authorizationService.roleDefinitions` replaced with `azure.subscription.authorizationService.roles`
- `esxi.service.uninstallable` removed as this is always `false`
- `k8s.container.image` replaced with `k8s.container.imageName`
- `k8s.ephemeralContainer.image` replaced with `k8s.ephemeralContainer.imageName`
- `k8s.initContainer.image` replaced with `k8s.initContainer.imageName`
- `k8s.podSecurityPolicies` and `k8s.podsecuritypolicy` removed due to the removal of this feature in Kubernetes
- `microsoft.application.createdDateTime` replaced with `microsoft.application.createdAt`
- `microsoft.application.displayName` replaced with `microsoft.application.name`
- `microsoft.tenant.displayName` replaced with `microsoft.tenant.name`
- `platform.vulnerabilityReport` on VMware replaced with `asset.vulnerabilityReport`

In the GitHub provider the previously deprecated and hidden `--repository` and `--user` command line flags are removed in favor of the `--repos` and `--users` flags.

If scanning using inventories in cnquery and cnspec the previously deprecated and hidden flags `--inventory-ansible` and `--inventory-domainlist` have been removed in favor of `--inventory-format-ansible` and `--inventory-format-domainlist`.

## Other improvements

- macOS nodes now use their serial number to identify the asset in order to prevent duplicate assets when users tether devices on mobile phones or change their machine name.
- Shell completion is now enabled by default for cnquery and cnspec on Windows.
- Detect Microsoft Exchange SU updates for improved CVE discovery with Microsoft Exchange.
- cnspec now automatically adds resource context to query results. This means that if you run for example a check on a Terraform HCL, and you are testing all resources, it will now capture the expected and actual values on each resource that fails so you can more easily remediate findings.
