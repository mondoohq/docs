Set up cases in a space to allow users in the space to keep track of security tasks and add Azure DevOps issues directly from within the Mondoo Console. Cases setup involves configuring Mondoo to integrate with Azure DevOps.

For an overview of cases, read [Track and Fix Findings with Cases and Your Ticket System](/platform/cases/overview/).

## Prerequisites

- Owner or Editor access to the Mondoo space

- An Azure account with access to Azure DevOps and Microsoft Entra ID

- An Azure service principal and client secret

  To learn how to create an Azure service principal and client secret, read [Securing service principals in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/architecture/service-accounts-principal) in the Microsoft Entra ID documentation.

## Add an Azure DevOps integration

1. In the Mondoo Console, navigate to the space where you want to set up cases and, in the side navigation bar, select **Cases**.

4. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that clearly shows this is an Azure DevOps integration.

5. In the **Provide the Azure DevOps organization URL** box, enter the organization URL (or OrgURL) for the DevOps organization to which you want Mondoo to add issues. This is the URL you use to access your DevOps organization in your browser.

7. In the **Provide the service principal ID** box, paste the client ID of your service principal. To learn how to create an Azure service principal and get its client ID, read [Securing service principals in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/architecture/service-accounts-principal) in the Microsoft Entra ID documentation.

8. In the **Provide the client secret** box, paste the client secret of your service principal. To learn how to create an Azure service principal and get its client secret, read [Securing service principals in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/architecture/service-accounts-principal) in the Microsoft Entra ID documentation.

9. Select the **CREATE INTEGRATION** button.
