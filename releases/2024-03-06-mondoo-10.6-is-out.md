### Filter policies on assets

https://github.com/mondoohq/console/pull/4012

### Data type conversion MQL helpers

New MQL helpers allow you to quickly convert data to the right format for your custom checks and data queries.

```coffee
> int(1.23)
1

> bool(1)
true

> float(12)
12

> string(1.89)
"1.89"

> regex("w.r.d") == "world üåé"
/w.r.d/
```

### Endpoint detection and response (EDR) policy

Ensure critical employee endpoints have endpoint detection and response (EDR) software installed and running with our new Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) policy. This policy checks to see if SentinelOne or CrowdStrike are installed on macOS, Linux, and Windows systems.

### Open source Mondoo documentation

Do typos in documentation keep you up at night like they do for me? We open sourced our documentation so you can fix that problem and end the sleepless nights.

Check out our new public repo at [github.com/mondoohq/docs](https://github.com/mondoohq/docs) for instructions on how to contribute fixes and improvements.

### Filter AWS scans by region

Filter cnspec command line scans by AWS region with new filter options:

Thanks for this great contribution [@montera82](https://github.com/montera82/)!

### Improved policy check impact scores

Prioritize the most important checks first with newly adjusted check priorities for CIS Linux distribution policies. These improved scores ensure that only the most important checks are listed as failures, so you can more easily prioritize critical work.
