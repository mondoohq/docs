## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Asset inventory at your fingertips

Query pack data now displays directly in the Mondoo Console for all assets. Explore asset configuration with the two dozen out-of-the-box query packs available in the registry. If you don't find what you're looking for there, write your own query packs to expose additional asset inventory information directly in the console.

Browse the results of asset inventory query packs with a new **Data Queries** tab on the individual asset view.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Expanded `certificate` resource capabilities

The `tls.certificates` resource now supports the PKIX Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension, as well as the Subject Key Identifier (SKID) extension.

```coffeescript
cnspec shell host google.com
cnspec> tls.certificates { sanExtension { * }}
tls.certificates: [
  0: {
    sanExtension: {
      uris: []
      extension: pkix.extension id = 5842ac625349147af543f8049f60497ca270c0412667bbeb1042482e805069f9:2.5.29.17
      emailAddresses: []
      dnsNames: [
        0: "*.google.com"
        1: "*.appengine.google.com"
        2: "*.bdn.dev"
        3: "*.origin-test.bdn.dev"
        4: "*.cloud.google.com"
        5: "*.crowdsource.google.com"
        6: "*.datacompute.google.com"
        7: "*.google.ca"
        8: "*.google.cl"
 ..
      ]
    }
  }
  1: {
    sanExtension: null
  }
  2: {
    sanExtension: null
  }
]
```

### Expanded cnspec status information

Running `cnspec status` now prints the version number of the latest available release and a list of all installed providers. If the currently installed and latest releases don't match, the status indicates that a newer version is available for download.

```text
