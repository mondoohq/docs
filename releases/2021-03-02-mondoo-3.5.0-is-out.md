This weeks release focuses on stability, improves the core DQL engine and improves policy queries to report accurate results. In addition, we managed to squeeze a few new features in:

- A new space wizard helps to quickly setup policies and agents for new spaces
- Advisories and EOL support for SLES 12, SLES 15, openSUSE and Fedora 32 & 33
- New Print Button

FEATURES

- new: dql `kernel.installed` adds support for the suse family
- new: added SLES 12, 15 and openSUSE advisory detection
- new: we added SLES 12, SLES 15, as well as openSUSE 15 to our EOL tracking
- new: added support for Fedora 32 & 33 advisories (current stable releases)
- new: added platform eol information for Fedora systems
- new: added static container analysis for Fedora 33

IMPROVEMENTS

- improve: we updated our error handling to make it for users to activate policies
- improve: `sshd.config.params` return normalized keys according to ssh spec to ensure the values have the same camelCase
- improve: extend `Ensure time synchronization is in use` control for `systemd-timesyncd` service detection across all benchmarks

BUG FIXES

- fix: ssh command execution throw a dql error and prevented dql queries from checking for exit codes
- fix: we fixed an issue were errors from data queries where not properly removed once they were running successfully
- fix: the scoring system for policy benchmarks has been updated from worst score to average score
- fix: vmware advisories have been updated to ensure 2021 advisories are properly stored in our database
- fix: handle case where dql query timeouts had influence on follow-up queries
- fix: update implementation of `Ensure cron daemon is enabled and running` for RHEL-benchmarks
- fix: `Ensure system accounts are secured` also checks for `/usr/sbin/nologin` for Ubuntu-benchmarks
- fix: handle case where hardened Windows 2019 installations do not return their product type, we fallback to member server as default
- fix: we fixed the implementation of Windows 2019 queries 2.3.11.9 and 2.2.32
- fix: fallback to `/etc/hostname` for platform identifier if `hostname` command is missing e.g on Arch Linux
