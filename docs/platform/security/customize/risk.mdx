Mondoo considers multiple [contextual risk factors](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/security/posture/findings/#factor-contextual-risk) when evaluating the security of your assets. To customize per your business's security priorities, you can choose which contextual risk factors affect your assets' scores.

For a finer degree of control over the impact that risk factors have on asset scores, you can choose not only _whether_ a risk factor affects scores, but _how much_ a risk factor affects scores.

The settings you choose to customize risk factors apply to all assets in the space. If you have multiple spaces, any risk customization you make in one space doesn't affect other spaces.
