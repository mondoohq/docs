description: Snooze or disable a check in a framework to customize how Mondoo evaluates your compliance with that framework

_Exceptions_ let you customize how Mondoo evaluates your compliance with a framework and communicate the reasons for that customization. They tell Mondoo to exclude certain [checks](/platform/compliance/monitor/frameworks/) when calculating your progress toward full compliance. There are two types of exceptions for checks:

- _Snooze_ a check to temporarily or indefinitely exclude its results from your overall compliance progress percentage. Snoozing is useful when you intend to comply with a check eventually but don't want it distracting your team right now.

- _Disable_ a check to instruct Mondoo to exclude it from your compliance score and explain this exclusion to your team. A check remains disabled unless you re-enable it.

:::info

When you snooze or disable a check, you snooze or disable it for the entire space. A check exception applies to the policy containing the check and impacts all compliance frameworks that use the check.

To learn about frameworks, policies, controls, and checks, read [Enable Compliance Frameworks](/platform/compliance/monitor/frameworks/).

:::tip

You can also snooze or disable an entire control in a Framework. To learn more, read [Snooze or Disable Controls](/platform/compliance/customize/exceptions/).

7. Select whether to **Snooze** or **Disable** the checks.

   If you select Snooze, select how long to snooze the check. Select **Indefinitely** to keep the check snoozed unless you un-snooze it.

8. Write a justification for the exception.

9. Select the **SAVE EXCEPTION** button.

## Approve or reject an exception

:::note

Only team members who have Editor or Owner access to a space can approve or reject exceptions in the space.

:::

Exceptions take effect the moment they're added. However, as an extra tracking step, a team member can approve or reject an exception:

- Approving an exception allows it to remain.

- Rejecting an exception removes it and re-enables/unsnoozes the check.

To approve or reject an exception:

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the space you want to work in.

   ![Space in the Mondoo Console](/img/platform/security/monitor-org.png)

4. Select the control containing the check you want to snooze or disable and then select the **Exceptions** tab.

5. Find the snoozed or disabled check you want to approve or reject.
