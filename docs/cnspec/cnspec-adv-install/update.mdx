cnspec is a versioned binary. To identify the currently installed version of cnspec, run:

```
cnspec version
```

To learn about cnspec provider versioning, read [Manage cnspec Providers](/cnspec/cnspec-adv-install/providers/).

## How cnspec versioning works

Mondoo's versioning policy is _based on_ the semantic versioning standard. For example, in version 10.8.4, 10 is the major version, 8 is the minor version, and 4 is the patch. When we release a new version, we increment one of these three version components depending on the type of changes we introduce.

### Breaking changes policy

Major version releases of cnspec contain _soft-breaking_ changes. These may require you to update your policies, query packs, or automation scripts in order to avoid disruption, but you have a long time to make those updates. We provide advanced warning before we make these changes, and they don't become _hard-breaking_ changes until the next major release.

### Supported releases

cnspec follows an N-1 support cycle, meaning the current version (N) and the immediate previous version (N-1) are officially supported. During this time, both major versions can communicate with the Mondoo Platform and execute all published policies and query packs. For example, if the current release of cnspec is 11.37, the Mondoo Platform supports all versions from 10.0 through 11.37. When cnspec 12.0 is released, the minimum supported version will become 11.0, and all earlier 10.x releases will reach end of life (EOL).

## Update cnspec

To update cnspec to the latest version, you can use your preferred package manager, such as Homebrew or Chocolatey, or simply re-run the installation script.

:::tip

Integrations that run on Mondoo Platform as well as the Kubernetes operator and the AWS Lambda-based integration, automatically update to the latest version; there's no need to manually update.
