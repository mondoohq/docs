cnspec assesses your Windows assets for misconfigurations that put your organization at risk. You can evaluate a Windows asset for compliance with security policies created by Mondoo or the community, or [create your own policies](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/). You also can write individual tests to run on the fly or include in automated tasks.

For a list of Windows resources you can test, read [Mondoo Operating Systems (OS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/os-pack/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core-pack/).

## Requirements

To test a Windows asset with cnspec, you must have:

- [cnspec installed on your workstation](/cnspec/)
- Access to the asset

## Assess Windows security with policy-based scanning

The Windows Security by Mondoo policy is available to all in Mondoo's [cnspec-policies GitHub repo](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec-policies/tree/main/core). This collection of tests evaluates how well your environment follows fundamental Windows security best practices.

To scan a local machine using the Windows Security by Mondoo policy, run:

```bash
cnspec scan
```

To scan a remote machine using the Windows Security by Mondoo policy, run:

```bash
cnspec scan ssh user@IP_ADDRESS
```

For `IP_ADDRESS`, substitute the IP address of the remote Windows asset.

If you prefer WinRM for remote access, enter:

```bash
cnspec scan winrm Administrator@IP_ADDRESS --ask-pass
```

For `IP_ADDRESS`, substitute the IP address of the remote Windows asset.

cnspec finds the default policy for Windows and runs a scan based on that policy. It returns a report summarizing the scan results.

To learn more about the command, read [cnspec scan](/cnspec/cli/cnspec_scan/).

You can also create your own policies to meet your specific needs. To learn more about policies, read [Policies](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/).

## Learn more

cnspec also provides an interactive shell in which you can explore. It helps you understand the checks that cnspec policies use, and write your own as well. Itâ€™s also a great way to interact with both local and remote targets on the fly. To learn more, read [Create Checks in cnspec Shell](/cnspec/cnspec-scan/).
