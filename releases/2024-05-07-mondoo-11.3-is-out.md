## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### All-new CIS Kubernetes policies

Mondoo now includes the latest CIS Kubernetes benchmark policies for self-managed Kubernetes clusters, EKS, AKS, and GKE. These policies include the latest CIS recommendations as well as all-new queries for improved output so you can remediate issues more quickly.

### GitHub organization scanning

Set it and forget it with complete GitHub organization scanning. Configure the integration one time and scan new repositories as they're created so you're never caught off guard.

Need more control over what's scanned? Specify individual repositories to include in the scan, or repos you'd like skipped.
