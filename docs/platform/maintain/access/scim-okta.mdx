Integrate Mondoo with Okta so you can:

- Enable users to log into Mondoo with their Okta account
- Control who has access to Mondoo using Okta
- Centrally manage users with Okta

## Prerequisites

To configure the integration, you need:

- An Okta account

- A privately hosted Mondoo [Enterprise account](https://mondoo.com/pricing)



## Configure Okta single sign-on for Mondoo (using OIDC)

To allow users to log into the Mondoo Console with their Okta-provided credentials, you create an Okta app integration for Mondoo. This implementation relies on [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) to authenticate users.

1. Log into your Okta Admin Console.

2. In the left menu, select **Applications**.

3. Select the **Create App Integration** button.

   ![Okta new app integration](/img/platform/maintain/access/okta/new-app1.png)

4. For the **Sign-in method**, select **OIDC - OpenID Connect** and for the **Application type**, select **Single-Page Application**. Then select the **Next** button.

5. For the **App integration name**, enter **Mondoo**.

6. For **Grant type**, select **Authorization Code** and **Refresh Token**.

7. For the **Sign-in redirect URI** and **Sign-out redirect URI**, enter the private domain you type to access the Mondoo Console, such as `https://console.YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.mondoo.com/`.

8. For **Assignments**, choose whether to give access to this new app integration for everyone in your Okta org, limit access to selected groups (and  enter the specific groups names), or defer assignments until later.

9. Select the **Save** button.

   Okta creates the app integration.

10. On the **General** tab of the app integration properties, copy the **Client ID**.

   Give the Client ID to your Mondoo representative, along with your Issuer URL, which is typically based on your company name: `https://YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.okta.com`

   For example, note the company **lunalectric** in the image above (in the top-right corner). The Issuer URL is `https://lunalectric.okta.com`.

## Manage Mondoo users with Okta (using SCIM)

To centralize user management for your organization, give your Okta account full control over who can use Mondoo. This implementation relies on the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol.

### Step A: Identify your Mondoo API and SCIM base URLs

To integrate Mondoo with Okta, you need your Mondoo API URL and Mondoo SCIM URL.

You can determine your Mondoo API URL based on the URL you use to access the Mondoo Console: Replace `console` with `api`. So if your Mondoo Console URL is `https://console.YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.mondoo.com` then your Mondoo API URL is `https://api.YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.mondoo.com`.

Add `/scim/v2` to the API URL to determine your SCIM base URL. So if your Mondoo API URL is `https://api.YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.mondoo.com` then your SCIM base URL is `https://api.YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.mondoo.com/scim/v2`.

### Step B: Create a Mondoo API token for your organization

To manage Mondoo users, Okta needs an API token from Mondoo that gives Okta **edit** permission for the Mondoo organization.

1. [Create a new organization API token with edit permission.](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/maintain/access/api-tokens/#generate-an-api-token-for-access-to-all-spaces-in-an-organization)

2. Keep the Mondoo Console open with your new token. You need it in the next step.

### Step C: FOO BAR FOO FOO FOO

DEETS

1. Log into your Okta Admin Console.

2. In the left menu, select **Applications**.

3. Select the **Browse App Catalog** button.

   ![Okta catalog search](/img/platform/maintain/access/okta/search-scim.png)

4. Use the catalog search box to search for “SCIM 2.0 Bearer” and select the “SCIM 2.0 Test App (OAuth Bearer Token)” application.

5. Select the **Add Integration** button.

   ![Add Okta SCIM application](/img/platform/maintain/access/okta/add-start.png)

6. On the **General Settings** tab, keep the default options and select the **Next** button.

7. Your Mondoo-Okta integration doesn't use any of that information on the **Sign-On Options: Required** tab, so just select the **Done** button.

8. Select the **Provisioning** tab, select **Configure API Integration**, and check the **Enable API Integration** box.

   ![Okta provisioning](/img/platform/maintain/access/okta/provisioning.png)

9. In the **SCIM 2.0 Base Url** box, enter the SCIM base URL you identified in Step A.

10. In the **OAuth Bearer Token** box, paste the token you generated in Step B.

11. Select the **Test API Credentials** button to ensure that the token and URL you provided are correct.

12. Select the **Save** button.
