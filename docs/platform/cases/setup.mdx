Set up cases in a space to allow users in the space to keep track of security tasks and add Jira issues directly from within the Mondoo Console. Cases setup involves configuring Mondoo to integrate with Jira.

For an overview of cases, read [Track and Fix Findings with Cases and Your Ticket System](/platform/cases/overview/).

:::note

Mondoo offers an alternative method for sharing cases with Jira: an email integration. This approach lets you tap into the automation features of [Jira's incoming mail handler](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/create-issues-and-comments-from-email/). To learn how to create an email integration for cases, read [Set up Cases to Email Your Ticket System](/platform/cases/setup-email).

:::

## Prerequisites

- Owner or Editor access to the Mondoo space

- A Jira account with access to the project where you want Mondoo to add issues

- An API token for Jira account access

  To learn how to create and copy an API token, read [Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/) in the Atlassian documentation.
