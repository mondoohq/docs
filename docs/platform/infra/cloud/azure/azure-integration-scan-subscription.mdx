The Mondoo Azure integration lets you continuously scan Azure resources, such as compute instances and databases, in one or more Azure subscriptions.

## Choose the manual or automated setup

Mondoo offers two approaches to setting up an integration for continuous Azure scanning: automated and manual.

Follow the [**manual setup**](/platform/infra/cloud/azure/manual-reg-path/) in these rare cases:

- You want to integrate Mondoo with all subscriptions in a management group

- You use the [legacy access policy permission model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-access-policy) for your key vaults (instead of RBAC)

- Your Azure environment is unusually large

All other users can follow the **automatic setup** described below.

## Prerequisites

Before you integrate Microsoft Azure with Mondoo, be sure you have:

- A Mondoo account with Editor or Owner permissions for the space in which you want to add the integration.

- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) with an active subscription and permission to manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Active Directory). Any of these [Entra built-in roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) include the required permissions:

  - [Global Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator) (required only if you want to scan Azure VMs)

  - [Application administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator)

  - [Cloud application administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator)

  In the Azure portal you can see what roles your user account has: Go to **Microsoft Entra ID > Users > (your user account) > Assigned roles**.

- Command-line access to Azure using [Azure Cloud Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart?tabs=azurecli)

## Add a new Azure integration in the Mondoo Console

After you've created, granted permissions to, and tested a new app registration, you can create a Mondoo Azure integration. You need some values from the app registration you created in the instructions above.

1. Access the Integrations > Add > Azure page in one of two ways:

   - New space setup: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **Azure**.

     ![Welcome to Mondoo Page](/img/platform/start/welcome_to_mondoo.png)

   - INTEGRATIONS page: In the side navigation bar, under **INTEGRATIONS**, select **Add New Integration**. Under Cloud Security, select **Azure**.

     ![********FOO REPLACE IMAGE************](/img/platform/infra/cloud/azure/add-int-azure-top.png)

     ********** BAZ PROCEDURE WILL CHANGE -- UI ISN"T FIXED YET *********************

2. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that lets you easily recognize the Azure tenant.

To continuously scan all subscriptions in the tenant, leave the **Scan all subscriptions connected to the directory (tenant) ID** toggle enabled.

   - To choose the subscriptions to scan, disable the **Scan all subscriptions connected to the directory (tenant) ID** toggle, select **Allow list**, and enter the subscription IDs. Type each subscription on a new line.

   - To scan **all** subscriptions except those you specify, disable the **Scan all subscriptions connected to the directory (tenant) ID** toggle, select **Deny list**, and enter the names of the subscriptions you don't want Mondoo to scan. Type each subscription on a new line.

6. To automatically discover all Linux and Windows VMs in your subscription and scan them using Azure Run Command, enable **Scan VMs**.

************** BAZ stuff here about copying command and pasting it in Cloud Shell **************

8. Select the **START SCANNING** button.

9. On the Recommended Policies page, enable the policies on which you want to base assessments of your Azure environment. To learn more, read [Manage Policies](/platform/security/posture/policies/).

10. Select **FINALIZE SETUP**.

Mondoo begins scanning your Azure resources. When it completes, you can see results on the INVENTORY page. To learn more, read [Monitor Your Infrastructure Security](/platform/security/posture/monitor/).

If your integration is unsuccessful, read [Troubleshoot an Azure Configuration](/platform/infra/cloud/azure/troubleshoot/).
