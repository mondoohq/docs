## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Continuous GitHub Enterprise scanning

Mondoo's GitHub integration has expanded to support GitHub Enterprise as well. GitHub Enterprise users can now get all the Mondoo GitHub features for their private instances, including scans of their GitHub configuration, as well as automatic discovery of Terraform code and Kubernetes manifests in GitHub repositories.

Check out the documentation to [learn more about integrationg Mondoo Platform with GitHub Enterprise](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/infra/saas/github/).

### IaC file discovery in GitHub and GitLab

Mondoo now automatically discovers and scans Terraform code and Kubernetes Manifests in GitHub and GitLab. Mondoo automatically scans static Terraform (HCL) and Kubernetes Manifests for security misconfigurations, enabling infrastructure developers responsible for writing and maintaining infrastructure-as-code for their organization to detect security issues before pushing changes to a remote repository.

Configure scanning in your existing GitHub and GitLab integrations.
