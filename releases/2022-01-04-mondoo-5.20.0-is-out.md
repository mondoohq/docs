ü•≥ mondoo 5.20.0 is out!

### üéâ NEW FEATURES

**Support for Terraform Objects**

Given a Terraform definition for:

```coffee
resource "google_compute_instance" "default" {
  name         = "test"
  machine_type = "e2-medium"
  zone         = "us-central1-a"

  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "debian-cloud/debian-9"
    }
  }

  // Local SSD disk
  scratch_disk {
    interface = "SCSI"
  }

  metadata = {
    enable-oslogin = false
  }
}
```

`metadata` is a defined object and not a block. The following query requests the arguments:

```coffee
terraform.resources.where( nameLabel  == "google_compute_instance" ) {
  arguments
}
```

Before this, the `metadata` was null because key/value pairs have not been parsed:

```coffee
terraform.resources.where: [
  0: {
    arguments: {
      machine_type: "e2-medium"
      metadata: null
      name: "test"
      zone: "us-central1-a"
    }
  }
]
```

With this latest release:

```coffee
terraform.resources.where[0].arguments: {
  machine_type: "e2-medium"
  metadata: {
    enable-oslogin: true
  }
  name: "test"
  zone: "us-central1-a"
}
```

**Support Linux kernel vault**

Storing credentials on disk is not recommended and Mondoo strongly advises doing so for production environments. Therefore we support various vault backends that allow you to store credentials in a secure way.

Given a simple inventory file that scans a Linux machine via SSH and password authentication:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-ssh-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    # Linux with password authentication
    - id: linux-with-password
      connections:
        - host: 192.168.178.28
          backend: ssh
          credentials:
            - user: chris
              password: password1! # implicit type password
```

With this inventory, you can scan the machine:

```
mondoo scan ‚Äîinventory inventory.yml
‚Üí load inventory inventory=inventory.yml
```

Of course, we do not want to store credentials in plain text files. In the past we assumed that we can do that via systemd secret service. The problem is that this interface is only working well with Gnome and KDE and is mostly bundled with Desktop environments. This is problematic for headless server.

To solve the issue meet Linux Kernel Key Management:

> NOTE: An introduction to [Kernel key management]([Kernel key management LWN.net](https://lwn.net/Articles/210502/)) explains how it works. See [keyutils](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/keyutils/keyctl.1.en.html) man page for more details
>
> On Debian `keyutils` need to be present to use the kernel key management:

```bash
apt-get install keyutils
```

Configure Mondoo‚Äôs vault to use the keyring `mondoo-client-vault` for secrets:

```
mondoo vault set mondoo-client-vault ‚Äîtype linux-kernel-keyring
‚Üí set new vault configuration name=mondoo-client-vault
‚Üí stored vault configuration successfully
```

Mondoo itself stores its configuration for vaults via Linux Kernel Key Management. The configuration is stored in `mondoo-cli-keyring` keyring and `user-vaults` key.

```
keyctl list @u
1 key in keyring:
599473326: --alswrv  1000  1000 keyring: mondoo-cli-keyring

keyctl show 599473326
Keyring
 599473326 --alswrv   1000  1000  keyring: mondoo-cli-keyring
 988442797 --alswrv   1000  1000   \_ user: user-vaults
```

Now we need to add a secret for a remove ssh connection. We set `mondoo-client-vault` as the key ring that Mondoo Client will use.

```bash
# The format to add a key is as following
# keyctl add user {desc} {data} @u
keyctl add user 'secret for 192.168.178.28' '{ "user": "chris", "password": "password1!", "type": "password" }' @u
52720293

# Next, lets display the key within the keyring
keyctl list @u
1 key in keyring:
 52720293: --alswrv  1000  1000 user: secret for 192.168.178.28

# lets display the created key
keyctl print 52720293
{ "user": "chris", "password": "password1!", "type": "password" }

# Later, we can delete the key from user scope via:
# keyctl purge -p user "secret for 192.168.178.28"
```

Now we can adapt the inventory:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-ssh-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    # Linux with password authentication
    - id: linux-with-password
      connections:
        - host: 192.168.178.28
          backend: ssh
          credentials:
            - secret_id: secret for 192.168.178.28
  vault:
    name: mondoo-client-vault
```

### üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

- Add end-of-life information for vSphere 7.0.0
- Improved handling for miss-configured `sudo` where SSH connections do not return the platform name properly
- Asset search is now case insensitive
- The AWS CloudFormation can be customized when creating the stack

### üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Fix Linux policies to check correct `cron` package name based on distribution
- Fix not found handling in AWS S3 resource. This would cause fields to error out instead of returning null when they were not set
- Fix awsec2ebs transport to not error out when there are multiple volumes
