### Improved software vulnerability experience

Find critically outdated software faster with the improved asset software tab. New quick filter buttons let you select between OS packages and applications. Badges help you narrow down risk with EPSS/CVSS3 scores.

### Resource improvements

#### aws.config.recorder

- New `resourceTypes` field

#### aws.vpc.flowlog

- New `destinationType` field
- New `deliverLogsStatus` field

### Control scanning during registration

Control the configuration of the cnspec service during client registration with new `timer` and `splay` flags in the `cnspec login` command.

Configure the cnspec service to scan every 30 minutes with a 5 minute splay:

```bash
cnspec login --token MY_TOKEN --timer 30 --splay 5
```

### Performance

The same great scans, just MUCH, MUCH faster. This week we shuffled around the bits to make GitHub organization scans 5x faster and Azure subscription scans 3x faster.
