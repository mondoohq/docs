Integrate Mondoo with Microsoft Entra ID with the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol so you can:

- Enable users to log into Mondoo with their Entra ID account
- Control who has access to Mondoo using Entra ID
- Centrally manage users with Entra ID

## Prerequisites

To configure the integration, you need:

- An Entra ID administrator account
- A privately hosted Mondoo [Enterprise account](https://mondoo.com/pricing)

### Create a SCIM application in Entra

1. Log into the Microsoft Entra admin center.

2. In the left menu, under **Applications**, select **Enterprise Applications**.

3. In the toolbar, select **+ New Application** and then select **Create your own application**.

   ![Create Entra enterprise application](/img/platform/maintain/access/entra-scim/create-app.png)

4. Type the name `Mondoo SCIM`, leave **Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)** selected, and select the **Next** button.

5. In the left menu, select **Provisioning** and again in the left menu select **Provisioning**.

6. In the **Provisioning Mode** box, select **Automatic**.

7. In the **Tenant URL** box, enter your SCIM URL.

   Determine your SCIM URL based on the URL you use to access the Mondoo Console: Replace `console` with `api` and add `/scim/v2`. So if your Mondoo Console URL is:

   `https://console.YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.mondoo.com`

   then your SCIM base URL is:

   `https://api.YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.mondoo.com/scim/v2`

8. Provide a token that gives Entra access to manage users:

   a. In a different browser tab, open the Mondoo Console and [create a new API token with **edit** permission to your Mondoo **organization**.](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/maintain/access/api-tokens/#generate-an-api-token-for-access-to-all-spaces-in-an-organization).

   b. Copy the generated token.

   c. Return to the Microsoft Entra admin center tab and paste the token in the **Secret Token** box.

9. SOMETHING ABOUT GROUP MAPPING IN SETTINGS THAT I CAN'T GET TO
