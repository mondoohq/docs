🥳 mondoo 5.22.0 is out!

### 🎉 NEW FEATURES

** Add the `where` method to `map` types **

Maps now have a `where` method that allows filtering by keys and values:

```coffeescript
mondoo> {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}.where(key == 'c')
```

```coffeescript
where: {
  c: 3;
}
```

```coffeescript
mondoo> {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}.where(value < 3)
```

```coffeescript
where: {
  a: 1;
  b: 2;
}
```

Currently, this only works with map types whose key is a string.

### 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

- Allow using the `--insecure` flag with `--inventory` when using the Mondoo CLI
- Automatically delete the CloudFormation stack when the AWS integration is deleted
- Add `ownerAlias` field to the `aws.ec2.image` resource

### 🐛 BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Fix potential panic when using `mondoo scan` with the `--inventory` flag
- Fix Ansible inventory loading for tags and multiple groups
- Fix `echo` warning when using PowerShell over SSH
- Fix bug where AWS EBS volume scan did not work for SUSE
