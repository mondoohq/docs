title: How Effort Is Calculated
sidebar_label: Effort

The **Effort** metric, shown in your **Top Actions** list, estimates the time required to remediate a finding. To provide a clear understanding of the work involved and the value of automation, we calculate Effort using two distinct models.

### 1. Industry Standard Effort (The Manual Way)

This metric benchmarks the time required for the **entire manual remediation lifecycle**. We model this at **10 minutes per affected asset**. This estimate goes beyond simply applying a patch and reflects the real-world, time-consuming tasks that operations teams face:

* Researching the correct fix for different OS versions and environments.
* Packaging and testing the fix to ensure it doesn't break dependencies.
* Performing staged rollouts across the fleet.
* Verifying that the fix was successful and the vulnerability is closed.

For a finding on 400 assets, this equates to **4,000 minutes (over 66 hours)** of manual work.

### 2. Mondoo Automated Effort (The "Fix Forever" Way)

This metric models the time required using Mondoo's **end-to-end automated remediation**. We calculate this at a highly efficient rate of **5 minutes for every 100 assets**.

The dramatic time savings come from automating the entire lifecycle that the "Industry Standard" number represents.

For the same finding on 400 assets, the Mondoo Effort is just **20 minutes**.

### At a Glance

The following table shows the powerful contrast between the two effort models for common findings:

| Finding             | Assets | Industry Standard Effort | Mondoo Automated Effort |
| ------------------- | ------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Windows KB #1       | 400    | 4000 min (66.7 hours)  | 20 min                  |
| Linux (setuptools)  | 180    | 1800 min (30 hours)    | 10 min                  |
| Windows KB #2       | 30     | 300 min (5 hours)      | 5 min                   |
| AIX Vulnerability   | 20     | 200 min (3.3 hours)    | 5 min                   |
| VMSA                | 8      | 80 min (1.3 hours)     | 5 min                   |
