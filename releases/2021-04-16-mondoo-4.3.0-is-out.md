This week's release ships with a major improvement for policy management. The new dashboard makes managing policies so much easier and avoids the back-and-forward navigation between policies and their settings.

üéâ FEATURES

- new: improved policy view

üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

- improve: change the winrm log messages for better tracking
- improve: reduce debug log messages for maintenance logging
- improve: we updated our protobuf api for agents

üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- fix: handle case in policy cli printer where no score exists for a policy
- fix: resolves an issue where agent check-in time was not tracked properly

:wastebasket: REMOVED:

- removed: CentOS 6 repository packages since the mirrors are not maintained anymore

**Improved Policy View**

User provided feedback that our previous separation of displaying policies and activating them via settings was not intuitive. The new improved policy view harmonizes those views into one and also introduces a multi-selection to allow the activation of multiple policies at the same time.
