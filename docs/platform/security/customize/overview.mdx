To meet your business's unique security needs, you can customize policies:

- [Change the scoring system](/platform/security/customize/score/) that a policy uses.

- [Set an exception on a policy](/platform/security/customize/policy/) to exclude certain checks from running.

- [Set an exception on an asset advisory](/platform/security/customize/advisories/) to exclude it from an asset's vulnerability assessment.

- [Change check properties](/platform/security/customize/props/) to customize the values that Mondoo scans for.

- [Define your security model](/platform/security/customize/risk/) to customize how risk factors affect your security scores.
