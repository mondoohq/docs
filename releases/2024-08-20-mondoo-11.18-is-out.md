## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### New policies for detecting NTLMv1 and SMBv1

Secure your Windows infrastructure against vulnerable legacy Microsoft filesharing and authentications protocols with the new Mondoo NTLMv1 Auditing Policy and SMBv1 Auditing Policy. These policies, co-developed with the wonderful engineers at [SVA](https://sva.de/en), ensure your using only modern and secure file sharing and authentication methods.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Space sunburst graph category improvements

Quickly understand where security problems lie with improvements to the spaces dashboard sunburst graph. The graph now groups IaC, network, and SaaS assets to quickly expose hot spots in your security posture. Dive deeper into each category with improved asset placement, so you can track down problematic services.

### Deeper AWS serverless integration scans

When a default VPC is in place, the Mondoo AWS serverless integration, now produces deeper security scans that include individual assets for common AWS resources and improved query outputs. Use these improved security scan results to navigate security issues in organization and spaces dashboards, and set granular exceptions on individual resources.

### Improved Compliance Hub look and feel

A new look in feel in Compliance Hub makes it easier to track your audit progress. Simplified progress bars show completion status and the check distribution graph has been replaced with easier to interpret icons for each exception state.
