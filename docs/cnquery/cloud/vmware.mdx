Rely on cnquery to explore and analyze VMware vSphere data centers, hosts, and clusters, Cloud Director deployments, and ESXI hosts.

cnquery provides the answers you need about every VMware environment. For a list of VMware resources you can query, read [Mondoo VMware vSphere Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/vsphere-pack/), [Mondoo VMware Cloud Director Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/vcd-pack/), and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core-pack/).


## Requirements

To analyze and explore your VMware environment with cnquery, you must have [cnquery installed on your workstation](/cnquery/) and access to the VMware environment.

## Explore vSphere with the cnquery shell

To launch a shell into your vSphere environment, enter:

```bash
cnquery shell vsphere USER@DOMAIN@HOST --ask-pass
```

| For... | Substitute...           |
| ------ | ----------------------- |
| USER   | Your vSphere user ID    |
| DOMAIN | The vSphere domain      |
| HOST   | The vSphere IP address  |


For example:

```bash
cnquery shell vsphere mwezi@vsphere.local@192.167.5.25 --ask-pass
Enter password:
â†’ loaded configuration from /Users/vj/.config/mondoo/mondoo.yml using source default

    Available assets

  > 1. 192.168.5.24 (vmware-vsphere)
    2. esxi-host2.localdomain (vmware-esxi)
    3. esxi-host3.localdomain (vmware-esxi)
    4. esxi-host1.localdomain (vmware-esxi)
```

When prompted, provide your password. When cnquery lists the available assets to query, choose one. You're now in the cnquery shell.

### Discover capabilities with the `help` command

Once inside the shell, use the `help` command to learn what vSphere resources you can query. This command lists all the vSphere resources:

```coffeescript
help vsphere
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down further. For example, enter this command to list all the vSphere cluster resources you can query:

```coffeescript
help vsphere.cluster
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down even further. You can also learn about available vSphere resources in the [Mondoo VMware vSphere Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/vsphere-pack/).

### Answer questions in the cnquery shell

Now that you know how to discover what's possible with cnquery, let's run some actual queries in the shell.

#### Query data centers

This query asks for a list of data centers, including their names and managed object IDs:

```coffeescript
vsphere.datacenters { name moid}
vsphere.datacenters: [
  0: {
    name: "Mondoo Datacenter-2"
    moid: "Datacenter-datacenter-8"
  }
  1: {
    name: "Mondoo Datacenter-1"
    moid: "Datacenter-datacenter-3"
  }
]
```

### Exit the cnquery shell

To exit the cnquery shell, either press `Ctrl + D` or type `exit`.
