## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### CircleCI Support

**Problem:** You want to use Mondoo natively with CircleCI projects to secure your build pipelines.

**Solution:** Mondoo now securely integrates with CircleCI projects to scan Kubernetes manifests, Terraform configuration files, and Docker images for common misconfigurations and CVEs. Check out the [CircleCI integration documentation](/platform/infra/supply/cicd/circleci/) to learn more.

### AWS Side Scanning From the CLI

**Problem:** You want Mondoo to scan your AWS instances, but you want to do it without SSH credentials or an SSM agent and without directly impacting your production workloads.

**Solution:** Mondoo now supports AWS side scanning. You can scan an EC2 instance, an EC2 EBS volume, or an EC2 EBS snapshot. See the [EC2 Snapshot Scanning documentation](/platform/infra/cloud/aws/aws-ebs-snapshot-scan/) for details.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Improved Linux Baseline Policy

**Problem:** You want the best possible out-of-the-box policies for securing your Linux systems.

**Solution:** Update the Linux Security Baseline policy to provide additional security recommendations. We've added 12 new controls to validate that users and groups are configured correctly on your Linux systems.

### Multi-line Support in Mondoo Shell

**Problem:** Writing complex MQL queries on one line can be frustrating.

**Solution:** The Mondoo shell now supports multi-line input!

### Copy MRN From the Asset Detail Page

**Problem:** It could be challenging to generate a properly-formed asset MRN to use with the Mondoo CLI.

**Solution:** You can now copy the MRN for any asset from that asset's detail page.

### Total Scans From the Vulnerability Page

**Problem:** Mondoo didn't provide enough context about vulnerability scans. It provided the number of findings, but didn't show the total number of objects scanned. If you had a system with no vulnerabilities, it could appear that Mondoo wasn't doing anything!

**Solution:** Mondoo now also shows the total number of objects scanned in a vulnerability scan.

## üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Resolves improperly failing queries in the macOS policy
- The Linux Security Baseline policy now correctly detects apache2 on Debian-based Linux distributions
- Improved Kubernetes admission controller reliability on small Kubernetes clusters
