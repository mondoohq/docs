## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### All new AWS Serverless integration experience

Over the past few months, our engineers have been hard at work on a complete rewrite of our AWS Serverless integration. This new release builds on our previous design incorporating valuable insights we've gained from securing AWS accounts at scale. What can you expect from this new release?

- **Enhanced Security** Our new design drastically reduces the number of privileges required to run in your environment so you can gather critical security insights without introducing new risks to your business.
- **Expanded Scalability** From the smallest dev account to enterprise-sized production accounts, Mondoo has you covered.
- **Granular Results** Our new approach to scanning provides resource-level scan granularity in more situations, giving you enhanced visibility into critical risks to your business.
