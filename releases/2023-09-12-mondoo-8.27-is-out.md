## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Improved CIS policy results

This week we further improved the reliability of our CIS benchmark policies, so you'll always have the best security compliance data for your infrastructure.

- Fix failures in the `Ensure permissions on bootloader config are configured` on some Linux distributions.
- Fix failures in the `Ensure permissions on /etc/shadow- are configured` when the `/etc/shadow-` file doesn't exist.
- Update the `Ensure local login warning banner is configured properly` and `Ensure remote login warning banner is configured properly` checks to also ensure the `/etc/issue` file exists.
- Fix failures in the `Ensure permissions on /etc/issue are configured` check when the `/etc/issue` file does not exist.
- Fix failures in the `Ensure permissions on /etc/issue.net are configured` check when the `/etc/issue.net` file does not exist.
- Fix failures in the `Ensure permissions on /etc/gshadow- are configured` and `Ensure permissions on /etc/gshadow are configured` checks on Debian-based systems.
- Fix failures in the `Ensure audit log storage size is configured`, `Ensure audit logs are not automatically deleted`, and `Ensure system is disabled when audit logs are full` checks when the `/etc/audit/audit.conf` file does not exist.
- Fix failures in the `Ensure at/cron is restricted to authorized users` if the `/etc/cron.allow` or `/etc/at.allow` config files don't exist.
- Add PowerShell remediation snippets to all Windows policies.

## 🐛 BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Pages in compliance that show check details now include breadcrumbs that take you back to the main compliance page.
- Allow users to update the private key in OCI integrations.
- Remove GCP BigQuery table count from the asset configuration overview to prevent long scan times in complex environments.
- Show an improved empty state page on security and compliance check pages that have no assets.
- Update the AWS integrations list page design to match other integration pages.
- Improve the rendering of the integration list page when the last integration has been removed.
- Fix missing check summary counts on asset pages.
- Fix some CVE scores showing up as "None" when they should be "Critical".
