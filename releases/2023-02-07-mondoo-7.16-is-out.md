## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### New UI navigation experience

**Problem:** There are many things you can do in the Mondoo Console, but sometimes it's hard to find what you need.

**Solution:** We rebuilt the navigation in the Mondoo Console from the ground up to make finding information and navigating your infrastructure easier. We replaced the top navigation tabs with a new navigation menu on the left side of the page. This menu includes frequently accessed sections of the UI that were previously tabs, such as Fleet, CI/CD, Integrations, and Policy Hub.

![New UI](/img/releases/2023-02-07-mondoo-7.16-is-out/new_ui.png)

Sub-items in the menu make it easier to find what you're looking for without having to navigate through multiple pages. For example to view Kubernetes integrations you can select Integrations -> Kubernetes in the menu instead of loading the Integrations page and then selecting Kubernetes. This new menu also includes quick access to the Mondoo Vulnerability Database, which was previously buried deep in the Policy Hub. If you're thinking "I didn't know there was a Mondoo Vulnerability Database," well, that's why we have new menu.

We have plenty more planned to fill out this new navigation menu, so stay tuned for new releases.

### New GCP, Azure, and Microsoft 365 integrations

**Problem:** You need to continuously assess the security of all your cloud and SaaS resources.

**Solution:** You can now configure continuous scanning of GCP, Azure, and even Microsoft 365 services through the Mondoo Console. There's no need to download an agent or deploy any code into your infrastructure. Configure ready-only service credentials in the Mondoo Console and let Mondoo do the rest.

### Manage vault secrets data with cnspec and cnquery

**Problem**: You want to use a Mondoo inventory file to scan multiple assets, but you also need to securely store any required secrets.

**Solution**: cnspec and cnquery now include the ability to manage secrets data in vaults directly using the command line.

Given an existing Mondoo inventory file:

```yaml
kind: Inventory
spec:
  assets:
    - id: 34.122.119.102
      connections:
        - host: 34.122.119.102
          backend: ssh
          credentials:
            - type: password
              user: chris
              password: mypwd
```

You can use this inventory file to scan all defined assets:

```bash
cnspec scan --inventory-file inventory.yml
```

To securely store the secrets in this vault, you can define a keychain vault:

```bash
cnspec vault set mondoo-client-vault --type keyring
‚Üí set new vault configuration name=mondoo-client-vault
‚Üí stored vault configuration successfully
```

Then confirm that the vault is configured with the `vault list` command:

```bash
cnspec vault list
vault  : mondoo-client-vault (keyring)
```

Next, add your secret to the keychain vault with the `vault add-secret` command:

```bash
cnspec vault add-secret mondoo-client-vault my-linux-user-secret '{ "user": "chris", "type": "password", "password: mypwd" }'
```

Now, you can reference the secret from the vault in your inventory:

```yaml
kind: Inventory
spec:
  assets:
    - id: 34.122.119.102
      connections:
        - host: 34.122.119.102
          backend: ssh
          credentials:
            - secret_id: my-linux-user-secret
vault:
  name: mondoo-client-vault
  type: keyring
```

Re-run the scan, and you will see that the secret was picked up:

```bash
cnspec scan --inventory-file inventory.yml
```

### New AWS MQL resources

**Problem:** You want to write policies to secure your Amazon ECR images and Amazon CloudFront distributions.

**Solution:** Mondoo now includes new resources for Amazon ECR and CloudFront so you can explore and secure even more of your Amazon infrastructure using MQL.

Querying ECR images:

```coffee
cnquery> aws.ecr.images { * }
aws.ecr.images: [
  0: {
    registryId: "172746783610"
    tags: [
      0: "latest"
    ]
    digest: "sha256:0c78b32ef7f3b41e3ed3115488d64a6faf7a3cdade2a5eb720092b6e8e0a88ca"
    repoName: "vjtestpriv"
    mediaType: "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json"
  }
]
cnquery> aws.ecr.publicRepositories { * }
aws.ecr.publicRepositories: []
cnquery> aws.ecr.privateRepositories { * }
aws.ecr.privateRepositories: [
  0: {
    uri: "172746783610.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/vjtestpriv"
    public: false
    region: "us-east-1"
    registryId: "172746783610"
    name: "vjtestpriv"
    arn: "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:172746783610:repository/vjtestpriv"
    images: [
      0: aws.ecr.image id = vjtestpriv/sha256:0c78b32ef7f3b41e3ed3115488d64a6faf7a3cdade2a5eb720092b6e8e0a88ca
    ]
  }
]
```

Querying CloudFront distributions and functions:

```coffee
cnquery> aws.cloudfront { distributions { *} functions { * } }
aws.cloudfront: {
  distributions: [
    0: {
      origins: [
        0: aws.cloudfront.distribution.origin id = 185972265011/test-1be01d1424077260.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

    }
  ]
}
```

### GitHub Repository Best Practices policy

**Problem:** You want to see the state of your GitHub repositories, including both security and best practices violations.

**Solution:** We split out non-security checks in the `GitHub Repository Security by Mondoo` policy into a new policy, `GitHub Repository Best Practices by Mondoo`, so you can report security and best practices issues independently from one another. We've also added a new query to the `GitHub Repository Security by Mondoo` policy to ensure repositories are configured to use Dependabot to report available updates for package management lock files, GitHub Actions, or Docker base images.

![New Policy](/img/releases/2023-02-07-mondoo-7.16-is-out/policy.png)

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Terraform configs now scan as `terraform-hcl` platform

It isn't always clear that the `terraform` platform in fleet view was Terraform HCL configuration files, so we've renamed the `terraform` platform to `terraform-hcl`. Existing assets will continue to scan and display as `terraform` until scanned with an updated client.

### Add `publicAccessPrevention` to `gcp.storage.buckets` resource

The `gcp.storage.buckets` resource now includes `publicAccessPrevention` data. Here's an example of querying this data out for all buckets in a project:

```coffee
gcp.storage.buckets { iamConfiguration['publicAccessPrevention'] }
gcp.storage.buckets: [
  0: {
    iamConfiguration[publicAccessPrevention]: "inherited"
  }
  1: {
    iamConfiguration[publicAccessPrevention]: "inherited"
  }
  2: {
    iamConfiguration[publicAccessPrevention]: "inherited"
  }
  3: {
    iamConfiguration[publicAccessPrevention]: "inherited"
  }
]
```
