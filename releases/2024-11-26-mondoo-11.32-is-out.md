## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Single command Azure integration

Integrate Mondoo with Azure with just a single command. No more worrying about setting up apps, configuring service principals, or generating certificates. Tell Mondoo what you'd like to scan in your Azure subscription and paste in the single command to CloudShell. Then kick back, relax, and let Mondoo do the heavy lifting.
