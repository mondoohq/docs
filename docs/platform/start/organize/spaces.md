![Spaces](/img/platform/security/spaces.png)

A space is a collection of assets, policies, and reports that you manage together within Mondoo Platform.

Spaces allow for a great degree of flexibility in managing shared resources. For example, teams may organize their deployments in spaces, setting their own policies and quickly gaining insights for everything they manage.

Furthermore, users may decide to configure separate spaces for development, staging, and production environments, or specific compliance requirements such as HIPAA or SOC 2.

:::note

Adding and removing spaces requires Owner access to the organization.

## Manage spaces

You can create new spaces as needed and use them to manage cloud account integrations, policies, and team members separately.

### Create a new space

1. [Navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to the organization in which you want to create a space.

2. In the left navigation, select **Spaces**.

3. In the top-right corner of the page, select the plus (+) icon.

4. Mondoo picks a space ID. To customize the ID, select the pencil icon and enter a new ID. The ID must be between 7 and 34 characters and can include lowercase letters, numbers, single quotes, hyphens, spaces, and exclamation points. It must start with a lowercase letter and end with a letter or number.

5. Enter a name for the space. The name must be between 4 and 29 characters long and can include letters, numbers, single quotes, hyphens, spaces, and exclamation points.

6. If you want, enter a description for the space to help your team understand its purpose.

7. Select the **CREATE SPACE** button.

### Delete a space

:::

2. Select the **SETTINGS** menu.

3. In the **Danger Zone**, under **Delete Space**, check the box to confirm you want to delete the space and all its related content.
