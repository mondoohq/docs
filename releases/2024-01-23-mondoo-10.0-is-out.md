## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Expose exploitable CVEs

Mondoo now flags CVEs found in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog. These CVEs are critically important to patch in your environment. Now you can track the patching status across your fleet to prioritize work.

Individual CVE pages include an exploitable badge when a CVE is in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog:

![Exploitable badge](/img/releases/2024-01-23-mondoo-10.0-is-out/exploitable.png)

From the CVEs page, a new yellow shield badge designates Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog CVEs.

### EPSS scores for CVEs

Now that you're done patching all the actively exploited vulnerabilities in your environment, what should you do next? What if you could identify vulnerabilities with a high likelihood of being exploited in the wild in the near future? That's the focus of the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS). Now Mondoo CVE pages include EPSS data so you can see how likely a vulnerability is to be exploited soon, along with the risk when that occurs. Use this additional data to spend your precious time patching the right systems before attackers hit.

### Console light mode

Do you feel like you merely adopted the dark instead of being born into it? Maybe it's time for change. Now you can switch from the Mondoo's Console's default dark mode to a new light mode.

Enable light mode by selecting the sun icon in the toolbar.

With light mode enabled, enjoy a brighter Mondoo!

### Policy stats on asset policy pages

The asset page's Policy tab now includes overview information summarizing the policies and results for an asset.

### Find your spaces with ease

Are you accumulating spaces as you secure more and more of your infrastructure? Now a space search makes it easy to find the space you need. The Spaces page for an organization also now includes pagination.

### Control policies using the CLI

Consider yourself a CLI wizard? You'll be happy to know you can now use the CLI to set how your policies execute on assets. The new `cnspec policy` commands give you complete control within the CLI:

```text
Usage:
  cnspec policy [command]

Available Commands:
  delete      Delete a policy from the connected space
  disable     Disables a policy in the connected space
  download    download a policy to a local bundle file
  enable      Enables a policy in the connected space
  format      Apply style formatting to one or more policy bundles
  info        Show more info about a policy from the connected space
  init        Create an example policy bundle
  lint        Lint a policy bundle
  list        List enabled policies in the connected space
  upload      Upload a policy to the connected space
```

## 🔨 BREAKING CHANGES

As this is a major release of Mondoo's cnspec and cnquery tools, we have made two relatively small breaking changes:

- We removed the `--share` flag in cnspec. To learn about other ways to report scan results, read [Report Results](https://mondoo.com/docs/cnspec/results/).
- We renamed `aws-ec2-volume` and `aws-ec2-snapshot` to `aws-ebs-volume` and `aws-ebs-snapshot` when using asset discovery to scan AWS accounts.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Scan performance improvements

New policy fetching and reporting optimizations in Mondoo 10 mean complex scans now execute nearly twice as fast and use 1/3 the network bandwidth as previous 9.x releases.

### MQL improvements

New helpers in MQL make it simpler to write and interpret complex security queries.

#### `recurse` helper for dicts

The `recurse` helper makes it easy to extract data from a dict structure made up of mixed value types.

For example, suppose you need to retrieve all users from this JSON data structure:

```json
{
  "users": [{ "name": "bob" }],
  "owners": {
    "admins": [{ "name": "joy", "isOwner": true }]
  }
}
```

Because of the varying data types, finding users in this structure is difficult with traditional mechanisms. You need to understand the data structure and know where to search.

`recurse` eliminates that difficulty:

```coffeescript
jdata.recurse( name != empty )
```

```coffeescript
[
  0: {
    name: "bob"
  }
  1: {
    isOwner: true
    name: "joy"
  }
]
```

You can then map the user names:

```coffeescript
jdata.recurse( name != empty ).map(name)
```

```coffeescript
[
  0: "bob"
  1: "joy"
]
```

#### Named arguments in functions

You can set a named argument in a function. This is useful in situations where you can only use one expression (such as with `all` or `one`). It also makes the code easier to understand, especially when nesting across multiple objects, as in this example:

```coffeescript
users.all(user:
  groups.contains(group:
    user.uid == group.gid
  )
)
```

#### `in` helper for lists of strings

For lists of strings, you can use the `in` assertion, which is the inverse of `contains`:

```coffeescript
"anya".in(["abel","amos","anya"])
```

An ideal use for `in` is to combine it with [properties](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/properties/). For example, if you define a property named `allowedCiphers`, you can assert that a configured cipher is in that list:

```coffeescript
sshd.config.ciphers.in( props.allowedCiphers )
```

### Resource improvements

This release includes new resources and resource fields to expose important details for asset inventory and custom security policies.

#### aws.iam.loginProfile

- New resource with `createdAt` field

#### aws.rds.snapshot

- New `createdAt` field
- New `engineVersion` field
- New `port` field

#### azure.subscription.networkService.securityrule

- Add `direction` field

#### ms365.exchangeonline

- New `sharedMailboxes` field

#### ms365.exchangeonline.exoMailbox

- New resource with `identity`, `user`, and `externalDirectoryObjectId` fields

### Group vulnerable packages by architecture

Vulnerability advisory pages now group affected packages by architecture for easier discovery and evaluation.

### PowerShell remediation steps in Windows policies

Windows policy checks now include PowerShell remediation steps in addition to the existing Group Policy steps, so you can remediate findings whatever way works best for you.

![PowerShell remediation steps](/img/releases/2024-01-23-mondoo-10.0-is-out/powershell_remediation.png)

### Simplified policy control

You can now change a policy's state directly from the Security Policies page. Now you can enable, disable, or preview policies without having to find them in the Registry.

### Control scan as service execution

You can now pass in alternative values to `cnspec serve` to configure the timer and its splay.

```bash
> cnspec serve --help
Start cnspec in background mode.

Usage:
  cnspec serve [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help                    help for serve
      --inventory-file string   Set the path to the inventory file
      --splay int               randomize the timer by up to this many minutes (default 60)
      --timer int               scan interval in minutes (default 60)

Global Flags:
      --api-proxy string   Set proxy for communications with Mondoo API
      --auto-update        Enable automatic provider installation and update (default true)
      --config string      Set config file path (default $HOME/.config/mondoo/mondoo.yml)
      --log-level string   Set log level: error, warn, info, debug, trace (default "info")
  -v, --verbose            Enable verbose output
```

To run `cnspec serve` from the CLI:

```bash
> cnspec serve --timer 30 --splay 30
→ start cnspec background service
→ scan interval is 30 minute(s) with a splay of 30 minutes(s)
```

If cnspec is running as a service, it is easier to configure the timer and the splay in the configuration:

```yaml
api_endpoint: https://us.api.mondoo.com
scan_interval:
  timer: 5
  splay: 10
auto_update: true
```

### Custom provider paths

Define a custom path to store cnspec and cnquery providers with the new `PROVIDERS_PATH` variable. Set this variable in your shell profile or change the path one time directly on the CLI:

```bash
PROVIDERS_PATH=$PWD/.providers cnquery providers install os
```

### Updated Linux EOL dates

We've updated many Linux distribution EOL dates based on vendor timeline updates:

- Extend EOL date of EuroLinux 9 to June 30, 2032
- Extend EOL date of Fedora 37 to December 5, 2023
- Extend EOL date of openSUSE Linux 15.4 to December 7, 2023
- Extend EOL date of Oracle Linux 7 to December 1, 2024
- Extend EOL date of Oracle Linux 9 to December 30, 2032
- Extend EOL date of Ubuntu Linux 23.04 to January 20, 2024
- Fix the EOL date of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 to be August 6, 2019

### Apple model detection

Asset platform information now includes the human-friendly form of the Mac model designation, including the year of release, so you can more easily understand scanned IT assets.
