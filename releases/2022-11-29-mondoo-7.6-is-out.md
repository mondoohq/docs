## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### New --asset-name CLI flag

The mondoo and cnspec CLIs include a new `--asset-name` flag that allows you to control the name of the asset when registering with Mondoo Platform.

### Fetch instance name using EC2 metadata

When connecting to instances using EC2 Instance Connect or SSM, Mondoo now identifies assets based on the instance name (from AWS metadata).
