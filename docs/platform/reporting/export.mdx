You can export your Mondoo space data in **CSV** or **JSONL** format for use in business intelligence, analytics, and reporting tools. This includes Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Zoho Analytics, or any platform that supports structured data input.

Exports are designed to help you visualize security posture, track compliance KPIs, investigate vulnerabilities, and integrate Mondoo data into custom reporting workflows.

## What gets exported

Each export includes a collection of structured files that represent key dimensions of your space’s security and compliance data. You can choose between `.csv` (comma-separated values) or `.jsonl` (JSON Lines) when generating the export.

| File Name       | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `assets`        | Inventory of scanned assets (hosts, cloud accounts, containers, SaaS apps) |
| `checks`        | Individual policy check results across assets                               |
| `controls`      | Groups of checks, typically mapped to compliance frameworks or policies     |
| `vuln`          | Vulnerability data including CVEs, severity, and remediation info           |
| `packages`      | Installed software packages per asset (used for vuln correlation)           |
| `queries`       | MQL queries used during evaluations (includes code, name, description)      |

Data can be joined across files using consistent keys such as `asset_id`, `check_id`, and `policy_id`.

## Manage your exports

- All previously generated reports are saved in the space’s Reporting page.
- To delete a report, click the trash icon next to its entry.
- To delete multiple reports at once, check the boxes and select **Delete**.

## Tips for using export data

- Load CSV or JSONL files into tools like Excel, Power BI, or Jupyter Notebooks for analysis.
- Use `vuln` data to build custom CVE dashboards or risk trending views.
- Join `assets`, `checks`, and `controls` for complete compliance reporting.
- JSONL format is ideal for programmatic ingestion into data pipelines and cloud storage.
