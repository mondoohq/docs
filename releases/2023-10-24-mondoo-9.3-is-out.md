- New resource [`azure.subscription.networkService.applicationGateway`](/mql/resources/azure-pack/azure.subscription.networkService.applicationGateway/)
- New resource [`azure.subscription.networkService.applicationFirewallPolicy`](/mql/resources/azure-pack/azure.subscription.networkService.applicationFirewallPolicy/)

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Updated Packer provider for Mondoo cnspec

[Our HashiCorp Packer cnspec provisioner](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/integrations/mondoohq/cnspec/latest/components/provisioner/cnspec) now uses cnspec 9.x, giving you access to the latest providers and resources directly in your OS image build pipelines.

### Updated CIS macOS benchmark policies

Mondoo now ships with the latest macOS CIS benchmark policies, which include expanded remediation steps, improved descriptions, and more resilient queries:

- Updated macOS 11 benchmark version to 3.1
- Updated macOS 12 benchmark version to 2.1
- Updated macOS 13 benchmark version to 1.1
- New macOS 14 benchmark (preview) 1.0

### Expanded compliance evidence gathering

We've revamped several of our bundled Mondoo policies with expanded descriptions, improved queries, and best of all, compliance mappings that help you automatically gather evidence no matter what the asset type:

- TLS/SSL Security Baseline
- Platform End-of-Life Policy
- Platform Vulnerability Policy

### cnquery run --info flag

A new `--info` flag in cnquery allows you to see which resources and fields your MQL queries use.

For example, running this query against the sshd config:

`cnquery run -c "sshd.config.params[Version] == mondoo.version" --info`

Returns this list of resources and fields:

```text
Resources and Fields used:
- sshd.config
  - params
- mondoo
  - version
```
