## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Create workspaces based on asset technology

Design your perfect workspace without all the clicking! Now Mondoo can dynamically include assets in (or exclude assets from) workspaces based on their general technologies, such as cloud families (AWS, Azure, GCP...) or functions (network, infrastructure as code, operating systems...). This lets you target assets in a general group without selecting each individual platform.

For example, previously to create a workspace made up of all your GCP assets, you individually specified 11 platforms: BigQuery Dataset, Compute Firewall, Compute Image, and so on. Now it's as easy as selecting one technology: GCP!

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Quickly jump to integrations from an asset

Quickly dive into integration configuration directly from scanned assets. A new link in each asset scan overview takes you to the integration that added the asset.
