When Mondoo scans an asset, it calculates a risk score that summarizes what percentage of the policy's checks the asset fails, weighted by each check’s impact.

Mondoo scoring is based on [policies](/platform/security/posture/pac/) that match the type of asset scanned. For example, there are policies for Windows, Linux, Kubernetes clusters, and so on. You [choose which policies are enabled](/platform/security/posture/policies/) in a space. If an asset matches multiple policies enabled in a space, Mondoo combines all matching policies to evaluate the asset's risk.

Mondoo scores policies from 0 (no risk) to 100 (critical risk) based on the weighted percentage of failed checks:

| From… | To…  | Risk score |                  Description                   |
|:-----:|:----:|:----------:|:----------------------------------------------:|
|   90   | 100  |  CRITICAL  |   Presents extreme risk to your organization   |
|   70   |  89  |    HIGH    | Presents significant risk to your organization |
|   40   |  69  |   MEDIUM   |  Presents moderate risk to your organization   |
|    1   |  39  |    LOW     |   Presents little risk to your organization    |
|    0   |   0  |    NONE    |     Presents no risk to your organization      |
