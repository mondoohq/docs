title: How the Space Risk Score Is Calculated

The **Space Risk Score** is a single, quantifiable metric from 0-100 that represents the overall security risk for a given space in Mondoo. A higher score indicates a higher risk posture, while a lower score means the space is more secure.

This score provides a high-level benchmark of your security posture, allowing you to track improvements over time. It is the score that the **Risk Reduction** metric for each Top Action directly impacts.

### How the Score Is Calculated

The calculation is designed to provide an intuitive measure of risk by averaging the scores of all findings and then inverting the result.

The final formula is:

**Space Risk Score = 100 - ( (Sum of All Finding Risk Scores) / (Total Number of Findings) )**

Let's break down the components:

* **Finding Risk Score:** Each individual finding has its own risk score from 0-100. A score of `100` is perfect (e.g., a passing check), while a score closer to `0` indicates a more severe risk. (Learn more in [How Mondoo Prioritizes Security Findings](../findings.mdx)).

* **Sum of All Finding Risk Scores:** We iterate through every asset in the space and sum the individual `Risk Score` of every finding.

* **Total Number of Findings:** This is a simple count of all findings across all assets within the scope of the calculation.

* **The 100-Minus Inversion:** The average of all finding scores results in a "health score" where 100 is good. We subtract this average from 100 to create a final "risk score," where a higher number intuitively means higher risk.

### How Exceptions Are Handled

The calculation intelligently handles exceptions. When a finding is marked as `Risk Accepted`, `False Positive`, or has a `Workaround`, its contribution to the sum is treated as a perfect `100`. This effectively removes its negative impact from the overall average.

### Example Calculation

Imagine a space with 2 assets and a total of 3 findings:

* Finding A (Critical CVE): `Risk Score = 5`
* Finding B (High Check Failure): `Risk Score = 20`
* Finding C (Medium CVE, Risk Accepted): Treated as `Risk Score = 100`

The calculation would be:

1.  **Sum of Scores**: `5 + 20 + 100 = 125`
2.  **Average Score**: `125 / 3 = 41.67`
3.  **Space Risk Score**: `100 - 41.67 =` **58.33**
