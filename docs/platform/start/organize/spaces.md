A space is a collection of assets, policies, and reports that you manage together within Mondoo Platform.

Spaces allow for a great degree of flexibility in managing shared resources. For example, teams may organize their deployments in spaces, setting their own policies and quickly gaining insights for everything they manage.

Furthermore, users may decide to configure separate spaces for development, staging, and production environments, or specific compliance requirements such as HIPAA or SOC 2.

## Manage spaces

You can create new spaces as needed and use them to manage cloud account integrations, policies, and team members separately.

### Create a new space

1. [Navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to the organization in which you want to create a space.

2. Select **CREATE NEW SPACE**.

3. Enter a name for the space. The name must be between 4 and 29 characters long and can include letters, numbers, single quotes, hyphens, spaces, and exclamation points.

4. Mondoo picks a space ID. To customize the ID, select **EDIT** and enter a new ID. The ID must be between 7 and 34 characters and can include lowercase letters, numbers, single quotes, hyphens, spaces, and exclamation points. It must start with a lowercase letter and end with a letter or number.

5. Select **CREATE SPACE**.

### Delete a space
