Mondoo can continuously scan a domain or IP address to ensure that your hosts follow best security practices. You can choose to monitor HTTP or HTTPS security.

To set up continuous scanning for a host:

import Partial from "../../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. Access the Integrations > Add > Domain or IP Address page in one of two ways:

   - New space setup: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **Domain/IP Address**.

   - INTEGRATIONS page: In the side navigation bar, under **INTEGRATIONS**, select **Add New Integration**. Under Network Security, select **Domain/IP Address**.

2. In the **Enter the domain or IP address to scan** box, enter the domain name (such as www.lunalectric.com) or IP address (such as 123.45.67.89) of the host to scan.

3. Under **Select ports to scan** box, choose to scan for HTTP or HTTPS security.

4. Select the **CREATE** button.

5. On the Recommended Policies page, enable the policies on which you want to base scans of the host. To learn more, read [Manage Policies](/platform/security/posture/policies/).

6. To complete the integration, select the **FINALIZE SETUP** button.
