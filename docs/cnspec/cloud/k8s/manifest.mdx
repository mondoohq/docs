Use cnspec to scan Kubernetes manifests for security and best practices. You can assess manifests using the same policies that you rely on for testing your live clusters.

To scan a Kubernetes manifest, you need a Kubernetes policy. If you haven't already [downloaded the Kubernetes Security by Mondoo policy](/cnspec/cloud/k8s/cluster/#assess-kubernetes-security-with-policy-based-scanning), do so now.

From the directory where you downloaded the policy, run:

```bash
cnspec scan k8s MANIFESTFILE
```

For MANIFESTFILE, substitute the path to the manifest file you want to scan. For example, run:

```bash
cnspec scan k8s luna-postgres.yml
```

cnspec returns a report summarizing the scan results.
