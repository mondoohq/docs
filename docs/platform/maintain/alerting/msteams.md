You can configure Mondoo to send a message to a Microsoft Teams channel whenever there's a change to an asset's security score. You do this by integrating Microsoft Teams with the Mondoo space from which you want to receive alerts.

Before you set up the integration, you must generate a new Microsoft Teams webhook URL.

## Create a webhook in Microsoft Teams

1. In Microsoft Teams app, select the team and channel where you want Mondoo to send alerts.

2. On the right side of the selected channel, select the ellipsis (...).

3. Select **Connectors**.

4. Search the Incoming webhook connector and select **Add** or **Configure**.
