Set up cases in a space to allow users in the space to keep track of security tasks and add Zendesk tickets directly from within the Mondoo Console. Cases setup involves configuring Mondoo to integrate with Zendesk.

For an overview of cases, read [Track and Fix Findings with Cases and Your Ticket System](/platform/cases/overview/).

:::note

Mondoo offers an alternative method for sharing cases with Zendesk: an email integration. This approach lets you tap into the automation features of [Zendesk email channel](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/5437005103002-Setting-up-your-email-channel). To learn how to create an email integration for cases, read [Set up Cases to Email Your Ticket System](/platform/cases/setup-email).

:::

## Prerequisites

- Owner or Editor access to the Mondoo space

- A Zendesk account with access to the channel where you want Mondoo to add tickets

- An API token for Zendesk account access

  To learn how to create and copy an API token, read [Managing API token access to the API](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408889192858-Managing-access-to-the-Zendesk-API#topic_tcb_fk1_2yb) in the Atlassian documentation.

6. In the **Email address** box, enter the email address you use to log into your Zendesk instance.

7. In the **API Token** box, paste your API token for access to your Zendesk account.
