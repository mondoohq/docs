## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Export data to PostgreSQL and Google Cloud Storage

What good is your security data if it's locked up in your security tooling? Now you have even more options for continuously exporting Mondoo security and asset inventory data to PostgreSQL databases or Google Cloud Storage buckets.

Space data exported to Google Cloud Storage bucket:

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Improved query result output

Query results now give you the context to dive in and fix issues:

Before:

```coffee
cnquery run gcp project lunalectric -c 'gcp.project.gke.clusters.all(databaseEncryption["state"] == "NOT_ENCRYPTED")'
...
    [failed] [].all()
      actual:   [
        0: gcp.project.gkeService.cluster id = gcp.project.gkeService.cluster/7c50e440aa5c41cf8eff749a4f313953c4c974b985ab43d1b44871e7dbf3e9a7
        1: gcp.project.gkeService.cluster id = gcp.project.gkeService.cluster/db3328e173c84de49d92229c02378c9f59b69e0a568a4448b52b3d7ff2f201f6
      ]
```

Now:

```coffee
cnquery run gcp project lunalectric -c 'gcp.project.gke.clusters.all(databaseEncryption["state"] == "NOT_ENCRYPTED")'
...
[failed] [].all()
  actual:   [
    0: gcp.project.gkeService.cluster {
      databaseEncryption[state]: "ENCRYPTED"
      name: "mondoo-gke-cluster-2"
    }
  ]
...
```

### Align cnquery with cnspec bundle commands

To make it easier to remember which command to use, we've updated cnquery to use the same command syntax as cnspec when managing policy bundles.

- `cnquery bundle validate` is now `cnquery bundle lint`
- `cnquery bundle upload` is now `cnquery bundle publish`
