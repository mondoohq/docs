The Mondoo Google Cloud Storage integration lets you continuously export your space data, such as assets and vulnerabilities, to a [Cloud Storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/buckets). The export runs approximately every 24 hours.

## Requirements

- A GCP account

- Editor or Owner access to the space from which you want to export data

## Create a service account for your Google Cloud Storage integration

To access the data it needs, your Cloud Storage integration needs a GCP service account. To learn about service accounts, read [Understanding service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) in the Google documentation.

1. Create a new GCP service account for the Mondoo integration to use.

   For instructions, read [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#iam-service-accounts-create-gcloud) in the Google documentation.

   Note the email address created for the new service account.

2. Create a JSON key for the service account.

   For instructions, read [Create and manage service account keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#iam-service-account-keys-get-gcloud) in the Google documentation.

   Save the JSON file that downloads to your workstation when you create the key. You need it to configure the integration (in the next section below).

## Create a Cloud Storage bucket

Your Cloud Storage integration needs a bucket to which to export data. To learn about buckets, read [About Cloud Storage buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/buckets) in the Google documentation.

Create a new GCP Cloud Storage bucket for the Mondoo integration to use. For instructions, read [Create buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) in the Google documentation.

2. Assign the "Storage Object Creator" role (roles/storage.objectCreator) for the bucket to the GCP service account you created in the instructions above.

   For instructions, read [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) in the Google documentation.

   For a description of the permissions that the "Storage Object Creator" role grants, read [Understanding roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#storage.objectCreator) in the Google documentation.

## Add a new Cloud Storage integration

1. Access the Integrations > Add > GCP Cloud Storage Bucket page in one of two ways:

   - New space setup: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **GCP Cloud Storage Bucket**.

     ![Welcome to Mondoo Page](/img/platform/start/welcome_to_mondoo.png)

   - INTEGRATIONS page: Navigate to **INTEGRATIONS**. Under Exports, select **GCP Cloud Storage Bucket**.

     ![integration-create-image](/img/platform/maintain/export/gcp-bucket/add-int-export-gcp-bucket.png)

2. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that lets you easily recognize the GCP project and bucket.

3. Identify the Cloud Storage bucket to which to export data.

   In the **Bucket name** box, enter the ID of the bucket you created in the previous section.

4. Under **Export as**, choose whether to export in JSONL or CSV format.

5. Under **Provide your Google service account config**, upload the GCP service account's JSON key that you downloaded in the previous section:

   Drag the file and drop it in the **Drag and drop your .json file here** box.

   OR

   In the **Drag and drop your .json file here** box, select the cloud icon and choose the file to upload.

6. To complete the integration, select the **CREATE EXPORT** button.

   Mondoo begins exporting information from your space. When this initial export completes, the integration status becomes **ACTIVE**. Mondoo performs an export approximately every 24 hours.

## View your Cloud Storage integration

1. In the side navigation bar, under Integrations, select **Cloud Storage**.

2. In the list of Cloud Storage integrations, select the integration you want to view.

### Statuses

The possible statuses for a Cloud Storage integration are:

- **pending**: The integration has been created but not yet run.
- **active**: The integration is active/healthy.
- **error**: Mondoo detected an error during export.

### Export data to Cloud Storage at any time

Mondoo exports your data to the bucket approximately every 24 hours. You can also manually export data at any time. Use the **SCHEDULE NOW** button to request an export right away. Mondoo begins the export as soon as possible.

### Remove an integration

To remove an integration, select the trash can icon. A confirmation prompt displays. Once you confirm the deletion, Mondoo removes the configured integration and stops triggering exports to the bucket.

:::info

Mondoo does not delete your GCP Cloud Storage bucket or existing exported data. You must delete the bucket manually.
