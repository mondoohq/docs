Managing cases includes:

- Viewing open and closed cases

- Examining case details and progress

- Closing cases

- Changing settings that control how cases work in a space

### View cases

On the Cases page in the Mondoo Console, you can view all the open and closed cases in a space and see the progress made toward fixing the assets they track. To view cases in a space:

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to the space.

2. In the side navigation bar, select **Cases**.

   Status bars show progress made by fixing the assets tracked in each case.

3. Select a case to see its details.

:::note

Changes you make to a Mondoo-case-based ticket in your ticket system do not affect the case in Mondoo. Similarly, making progress on a case in Mondoo doesn't update the corresponding ticket in your ticket system.

:::

## Close a case

Close a case to indicate that the work is completed or to stop tracking it. You can close a case from the list of cases or from the case detail page.

import Partial from "../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to the space.

2. In the side navigation bar, select **Cases**.

   Status bars show progress made by fixing the assets tracked in each case.

3. To close the case, either:

   - Select the **CLOSE CASE** button on the row of the case you want to close

   ![Close a case in Mondoo from the open cases list](/img/platform/cases/cases-list-close.png)

   or

   - select the case you want to close and then select the **CLOSE CASE** button near the top-right corner of the case detail page.

:::note

Closing an ticket or issue in your ticket system or does not close the corresponding case in Mondoo. If you create cases using a [direct Jira integration], a space-wide setting controls whether closing a case in Mondoo automatically closes the corresponding issue in Jira. To learn more, read the "Change cases settings" below.

### Change cases settings

![Space-wide cases settings](/img/platform/cases/space-settings.png)

Space-wide settings control the details of how cases work:

- **Automatically create cases on drift** - When enabled, Mondoo creates a case when an asset that passed a check in a previous scan now fails the check.
