Use cases to track the work of fixing failed checks in your existing workflow. When a Mondoo space has the [cases feature configured](/platform/cases/overview/), any team member can create a case from an advisory. Creating a case can either:

- Directly create a new a Jira issue, GitHub issue, GitLab issue, or Zendesk ticket

- Send an email message to the recipient of your choice, such as a listener for your ticket, issue tracking, or project management software

For an overview of cases, read [Track and Fix Findings with Cases and Your Ticket System](/platform/cases/overview/).

import Partial from "../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to a space that is set up to use cases.

   :::tip

   You can also select a [workspace](/platform/start/organize/workspaces/) to view a subset of assets within a space.

   :::

2. In the side navigation bar, under **Security**, select **Checks**.

3. Select the check you want to track using a case and a corresponding issue in your ticket system.

4. To the right of the check name, select the **CREATE CASE** button and select **Selected Assets** to jump to the bottom of the page and see all assets affected by the advisory. (You can also select **All Assets** to create a case for all assets affected by the advisory.)

5. Check the boxes beside all the assets for which you want to track this advisory. Note that this creates a single case (and therefore a single ticket in your ticket system) for all the assets you choose. (If you want to track assets separately, create a new case for each asset.)

   Select the **CREATE CASE** button.

6. Define the case:

   - In the **Integration** box, specify where you want Mondoo to add or send the case information.

   - Choose the external destination for the case, such as the project, email recipient, or organization and repository.

   - If you want, change the **Summary** (title) and add your own notes in the **Additional comments** box.

7. Select the **CREATE CASE** button.

   Mondoo creates a new case in the space and then creates a corresponding issue or ticket in your ticket system, or sends email to the selected recipient.
