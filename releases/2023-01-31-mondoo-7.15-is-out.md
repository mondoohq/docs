## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### CSV output format for cnquery

**Problem:** You want to export cnquery results to a spreadsheet for analysis.

**Solution:** The cnquery CLI can now produce CSV output on the CLI for integration spreadsheet apps or other systems that parse CSV input.

```bash
cnquery scan docker debian:11 --output csv > report.csv
```

### Terraform in the Fleet view

**Problem:** You want to use cnspec to secure your Terraform code, but it's hard to find Terraform code results when they show up as uncategorized assets.

**Solution:** A new Terraform section in the Fleet view makes it easy to find all your Terraform scans in one place.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Only show applicable controls in the console

Controls that are cnspec automatically skipped are no longer shown as disabled in the Mondoo console. Depending on the policy and infrastructure scanned, there could be several dozen controls that cnspec skipped automatically. This new behavior simplifies the asset controls view and makes it more clear which controls ran and which you disabled.

### Improved CLI scanning UX

After launching our updated CLI UX last week, we got loads of great feedback from the community on how we could continue to improve the experience. This week we shipped several improvements to make it easier to read the scan output and to improve the experience when scans fail.

### Org names in shared space titles

Differentiating between shared spaces can be difficult if the space names are the same. Shared spaces now include the org and space name, so you can better tell spaces apart.

### Updated GCP CIS policy

Mondoo now includes the latest `CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark` policy version 2.0.0. This updated policy uses the latest new resources shipped with the latest versions of cnspec. It includes many new queries as well as audit and remediation steps for all queries.

### Install cnspec using Ansible

The Mondoo Ansible role has been updated to make deploying and migrating to cnspec at scale easier. This updated role deploys cnspec and cnquery to new systems and upgrades existing installations to use cnspec and cnquery. Just run this role against systems, and you'll automatically have the latest cnspec release running as a service.
