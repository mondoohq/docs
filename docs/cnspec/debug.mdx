cnspec has a debug scan mode that outputs detailed information for troubleshooting problems scanning an asset. This is helpful when you're getting support from Mondoo. It creates files that you can share with us so we can see exactly what happened during a scan.

:::warning

Debug output files can contain sensitive data. Do not share them anywhere public, such as a public repository or channel.

:::

To scan in debug mode, preface the `cnspec scan` command with `DEBUG=1.` These are some examples:

```bash
DEBUG=1 cnspec scan

DEBUG=1 cnspec scan aws --region us-east-1

DEBUG=1 cnspec scan oci
```

To learn more about the `cnspec scan` command, read [cnspec scan](/cnspec/cli/cnspec_scan).

cnspec creates debug data files in the local directory from which you run the scan. All debug data file names begin with `mondoo-debug` so it's easy to see which files to send to Mondoo.
