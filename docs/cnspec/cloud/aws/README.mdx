cnspec assesses your full AWS environment for misconfigurations that put your organization at risk. You can scan your AWS account for compliance with security policies created by Mondoo or the community, or [create your own policies](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/). You also can write individual tests to run on the fly or include in automated tasks.

cnspec can test any aspect of your AWS configuration. For a list of AWS resources you can test, read [Mondoo Amazon Web Services (AWS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/aws-pack/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core-pack/).

## Connect cnspec with your AWS environment

### Requirements

To analyze and explore your AWS environment with cnspec, you must have:

- [cnspec installed on your workstation](/cnspec/).
- [An AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
- Your AWS credentials. To learn about creating a new access key pair, read [Creating new access keys for an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/access.credentials.html#create.keypair) in the AWS documentation.
- Your `AWS_REGION` configured. To learn how to set your region, read [How to set environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-set) in the AWS documentation.

### Set up AWS credentials

To ensure your AWS credentials are set up properly so you can scan from your workstation, run this command from a terminal:

```bash
cat ~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
aws_session_token = AQoDYXdzEJr...<remainder of session token>
```

If you want to use a specific profile, set `AWS_PROFILE`

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=PROFILENAME
```

For PROFILENAME, substitute the name of the profile to use.

### Permissions required to scan an AWS account

cnspec requires read-only access to assess the configuration of the services and resources within an AWS account. It uses the credentials for the `awscli` to authenticate with the AWS API. So it inherits the permissions granted to your AWS access keys.

:::info

Amazon provides the **ReadOnlyAccess** IAM profile, which grants read-only access to all AWS Services.

:::

### Verify with a quick AWS check

To quickly confirm that cnspec has access to your AWS environment, run this test from your terminal:

```bash
cnspec run aws -c 'aws.account.id!="foo"'
```

It asserts that your AWS account ID value is not `foo`.

cnspec returns `[ok]` to indicate that the test passed, and includes the actual value of the AWS account ID:

```coffeescript
[ok] value: "123456789000"
```

### Scan an AWS account with cnspec

To scan an AWS account remotely with cnspec, enter this command in a terminal:

```bash
cnspec scan aws
```

cnspec scans the account using any AWS policies you have enabled in your Mondoo account. It prints the results to `STDOUT` on the command line. It also sends the results to Mondoo Platform, which generates a report for each policy executed against the account.

### Manage multiple AWS profiles

If you manage multiple AWS configurations in your credentials file, you can set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to specify which profile to use for each scan. For example, this credentials file has two configurations:

```bash title='~/.aws/credentials'
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

[aws-dev-account]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
```

When you run a scan, you specify which profile to use:

```bash title="Select AWS profile to scan"
export AWS_PROFILE=PROFILENAME
cnspec scan aws
```

For PROFILENAME, substitute the name of the profile to use.

### Incognito mode

cnspec provides an `--incognito` mode, which lets you scan your AWS account against a specific policy without sending the results back to Mondoo Platform. This can be helpful for assessing how an account will score against a policy before enabling it.

To scan an AWS account using `incognito` mode, enter this command in a terminal:

```bash
cnspec scan aws --incognito
```

## Perform agentless scans of EC2 instances

cnspec supports remote scanning of EC2 instances without installing an agent on the instance. This lets you assess your instances on demand. You must have remote connectivity to instances, either through SSH or EC2 Instance Connect.

### Scan an EC2 instance using EC2 Instance Connect

import Partial from "./_aws-incl-ic.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

### Scan an EC2 instance using SSH

cnspec lets you remotely scan EC2 instances using SSH:

```bash
cnspec scan aws ec2 instance-connect USER@HOST --identity-file PATH
```

| For... | Substitute...                           |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| USER   | Your user name for the AWS account      |
| HOST   | The instance's public IP address or DNS |
| PATH   | The path to the SSH key file            |

## Next step

You've successfully used cnspec to run your first check against your AWS account. Now you're ready to [assess your AWS environment.](/cnspec/cloud/aws/account)
