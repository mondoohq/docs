## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### New asset configuration insights

Have you ever struggled to respond to a security alert because you couldn't locate the asset in your infrastructure? Now with Mondoo, you can quickly track down assets in your environment, thanks to new asset configuration information available in the Mondoo console. This new configuration data includes important asset metadata such as accounts and regions for cloud assets or make, model, and serial number for physical assets. Mondoo automatically collects this data so you don't have to worry about enabling additional policies or query packs.

Example cloud asset:
