Integrate Mondoo with Okta so you can:

- Enable users to log into Mondoo with their Okta account
- Control who has access to Mondoo using Okta
- Centrally manage users with Okta

Configuring single sign-on allows Okta to handle authentication (verifying that a user is who they say they are) for Mondoo. Configuring user management allows Okta to handle authorization (which users can do what) for Mondoo.

You can choose to set up Okta single sign-on but not Okta user management. However, you can't use Okta for Mondoo user management without first setting up Okta single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To configure the integration, you need:

- An Okta administrator account
- A privately hosted Mondoo [Enterprise account](https://mondoo.com/pricing)

Let your Mondoo representative know that you want to enable Okta single sign-on for your Mondoo Enterprise account. The Mondoo team executes the final step in configuring Okta single sign-on using information you provide.

## Configure Okta single sign-on for Mondoo (using OIDC)

To allow users to log into the Mondoo Console with their Okta-provided credentials, you create an Okta app integration for Mondoo. This implementation relies on [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) to authenticate users.

1. Log into your Okta Admin Console.

2. In the left menu, select **Applications**.

3. Select the **Create App Integration** button.

   ![Okta new app integration](/img/platform/maintain/access/okta/new-app1.png)

4. For the **Sign-in method**, select **OIDC - OpenID Connect** and for the **Application type**, select **Single-Page Application**. Then select the **Next** button.

   ![Okta new app integration](/img/platform/maintain/access/okta/new-app2.png)

5. For the **App integration name**, enter **Mondoo**.

6. For **Grant type**, select **Authorization Code** and **Refresh Token**.

7. For the **Sign-in redirect URI** and **Sign-out redirect URI**, enter the private domain you type to access the Mondoo Console, such as `https://console.YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.mondoo.com/`.

8. For **Assignments**, choose to limit access to selected groups and enter the specific groups names.

9. Select the **Save** button.

   Okta creates the app integration.

   ![Okta applications](/img/platform/maintain/access/okta/app-props.png)

10. On the **General** tab of the app integration properties, copy the **Client ID**. Share this with your Mondoo representative.

11. In the top-right corner of the the Okta Admin Console, select the drop-down beside your user ID.

   ![Okta issuer ID](/img/platform/maintain/access/okta/issuer-id.png)

   Below your name and email address is an **Issuer ID**. Select the Copy to Clipboard icon beside the issuer ID and share the issuer ID with your Mondoo representative.

The Mondoo team uses the Client ID and Issuer ID to enable Okta single sign-on for your Mondoo Enterprise account. After we let you know we've executed this final step, it can take 10-20 minutes before users can log into Mondoo using Okta single sign-on.

## Manage Mondoo users with Okta (using SCIM)

To centralize user management for your organization, give your Okta account full control over who can access organizations and spaces and perform different tasks in Mondoo. This implementation relies on the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol.

Before you set up Okta user management for Mondoo, you must first configure Okta single sign-on by following the steps above. Make sure a user can log into Mondoo using Okta single sign-on before you continue.

### Create a SCIM application in Okta

1. Log into your Okta Admin Console.

2. In the left menu, select **Applications**.

   ![Okta applications](/img/platform/maintain/access/okta/applications.png)

3. Select the **Browse App Catalog** button.

   ![Okta catalog search](/img/platform/maintain/access/okta/search-scim.png)

4. Use the catalog search box to search for “SCIM 2.0 Bearer” and select the “SCIM 2.0 Test App (OAuth Bearer Token)” application.

   ![Okta SCIM application](/img/platform/maintain/access/okta/scim-info.png)

5. Select the **Add Integration** button.

   ![Add Okta SCIM application](/img/platform/maintain/access/okta/add-start.png)

6. On the **General Settings** tab, keep the default options and select the **Next** button.

7. Your Mondoo-Okta integration doesn't use any of that information on the **Sign-On Options: Required** tab, so just select the **Done** button.

### Provision users in Okta

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab, select **Configure API Integration**, and check the **Enable API Integration** box.

   ![Okta provisioning](/img/platform/maintain/access/okta/provisioning.png)

2. In the **SCIM 2.0 Base Url** box, enter your Mondoo SCIM base URL.

   Determine your SCIM base URL using the URL you use to access the Mondoo Console: Replace `console` with `api` and add `/scim/v2`. So if your Mondoo Console URL is:

   `https://console.YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.mondoo.com`

   then your SCIM base URL is:

   `https://api.YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.mondoo.com/scim/v2`


3. Provide a token that gives Entra access to manage users:

   a. In a different browser tab, open the Mondoo Console and [create a new API token with **edit** permission to your Mondoo **organization**.](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/maintain/access/api-tokens/#generate-an-api-token-for-access-to-all-spaces-in-an-organization).

   b. Copy the generated token.

   c. Return to the Okta Admin Console tab and paste the token in the **OAuth Bearer Token** box.

4. Select the **Test API Credentials** button to ensure that the token and URL you provided are correct.

5. Select the **Save** button.

6. In the left menu, select **ToApp** and enable these capabilities:

   - Create Users
   - Update User Attributes
   - Deactivate Users

7. Select the **Assignments** tab and add the groups to which you want to grant Mondoo access.

8. Select the **Push Groups** tab and add the same groups as in step 7.

### Manage Mondoo organization and space access using your Mondoo API playground

Your Mondoo API playground is a GraphQL environment unique to your Mondoo Enterprise account. Determine your the URL for your playground based on the URL you use to access the Mondoo Console: Replace `console` with `api`. So if your Mondoo Console URL is:

`https://console.YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.mondoo.com`

then your playground URL is:

`https://api.YOUR-COMPANY-NAME.mondoo.com`

Copy and paste this query, replacing FOO FOO FOO

```coffeescript
mutation {
  setScimGroupMapping(
    input: {
      orgMrn: "//captain.api.mondoo.app/organizations/dreamy-bartik-265385",
      group: "API Admins",
      mappings: [{
        orgMrn: "//captain.api.mondoo.app/organizations/dreamy-bartik-265385",
        #spaceMrn: "//captain.api.mondoo.app/spaces/pedantic-mestorf-965815",
        iamRole: "//iam.api.mondoo.app/roles/editor"
      },{
        #orgMrn: "//captain.api.mondoo.app/organizations/dreamy-bartik-265385",
        spaceMrn: "//captain.api.mondoo.app/spaces/pedantic-mestorf-965815",
        iamRole: "//iam.api.mondoo.app/roles/editor"
      },{
        #orgMrn: "//captain.api.mondoo.app/organizations/dreamy-bartik-265385",
        spaceMrn: "//captain.api.mondoo.app/spaces/pedantic-mestorf-12323",
        iamRole: "//iam.api.mondoo.app/roles/viewer"
      }]
    }
  ) {
    group
  }
}
```

Set the authentication to headers: (Get token by typing “info” in the dashboard)

```
{
  "authorization":"Bearer TOKEN"
}
```
