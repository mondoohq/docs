## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Atlassian Jira ticketing integration

Exposing critical issues is only half the journey toward a secure and compliant infrastructure. The next step is effectively communicating these findings to the appropriate teams and tracking remediation progress. Take the work out of communicating your findings with Mondoo's new Atlassian Jira integration.

![Create Jira ticket](/img/releases/2023-07-04-mondoo-8.17-is-out/create_jira_ticket.png)

Automatically create issues directly in Atlassian Jira so teams can schedule remediation work within their existing project workflows. Without ever leaving the Mondoo Console, you can create Jira tickets that include all the details necessary for infrastructure owners to remediate findings, even if they don't have access to Mondoo.

### GCP snapshot scanning

In Mondoo 8.16, we introduced GCP VM instance scanning using snapshots, allowing you to scan running instances without agents or impact on production workloads. This week we're extending our GCP scanning options with support for scanning snapshots by name. With snapshot scanning, you scan different point-in-time snapshots of VMs, giving you deep insights into systems at a particular point in time as well as security over time.

```shell
cnquery shell gcp snapshot suse12 --project-id my-project-id
→ discover related assets for 1 asset(s)
→ resolved assets resolved-assets=1
→ found target volume device name=/dev/sdb3

### Continuous Azure VM scanning

Scanning Azure VMs is easier than ever with our Azure integration's new continuous VM scanning feature. Automatically scan all VMs in your subscription without needing to deploy agents or change your provisioning process.

To enable VM scanning, select the **Scan VMs** option during the Azure integration setup.

![Scan VMs Option](/img/releases/2023-07-04-mondoo-8.17-is-out/scan_vms.png)

Mondoo discovers all Linux and Windows VMs in your subscription automatically and scans these VMs using Azure's built-in Run Commands functionality.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Use the latest existing snapshot for GCP VM instance scanning

Want to scan GCP VM instances by snapshot, but don't want to wait for a new snapshot to be created? Now you can scan GCP instances using existing VM snapshots with the new `--use-latest-snapshot` flag.

```shell
cnspec scan gcp instance sles12 --project-id my-project-id --zone us-central1-a --use-latest-snapshot
→ no Mondoo configuration file provided. using defaults
→ discover related assets for 1 asset(s)
→ resolved assets resolved-assets=1
