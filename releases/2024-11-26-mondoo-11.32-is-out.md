## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Single-command Azure integration

Integrate Mondoo and Azure with just a single command. No more worrying about setting up apps, configuring service principals, or generating certificates. Tell Mondoo what you'd like to scan in your Azure subscription and paste the command in CloudShell. Then kick back, relax, and let Mondoo do the heavy lifting.

### Detect EOL dates for Windows LTSC and LTSB releases
