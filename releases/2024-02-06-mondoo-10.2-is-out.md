## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Additional sources for CVEs and advisories

For vulnerabilities that have known exploits in the wild, Mondoo now provides a link to the external citation from the CVE page:

- For software vulnerabilities listed in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) catalog, Mondoo now provides a link to the catalog entry.

- For software vulnerabilities listed in Metasploit, Mondoo now provides a link to exploit in the Metasploit source repository.

### Find top vulnerabilities for spaces

The space overview now shows the top vulnerability in the space, as determined by the ratio of impacted assets and CVSS score.

### `slack.users` performance improvements

We continue to optimize fetching Slack data for large Slack workspaces. New optimizations for user fetching result in query times up to 25x faster.

### New `sshd.config.blocks` field

The `ssh.config` resource now includes a new `blocks` field that allows you to query configuration data defined in individual sshd match groups.

For example, if you have an sshd configuration file with a match group for `sftp-users`:

```coffee
...
X11Forwarding yes

Match Group sftp-users
X11Forwarding no
PermitRootLogin no
AllowTCPForwarding yes
```

Previously using the `sshd.config.params` field would show you both instances of the `X11Forwarding` configuration without the context necessary to understand where this configuration is applied:

```coffee
> sshd.config.params.X11Forwarding
"no,yes"
```

Using blocks you can dive deeper to see exactly which users get each configuration option:

```coffee
> sshd.config.blocks { criteria params }
sshd.config.blocks: [
  0: {
    criteria: ""
    params: {
      X11Forwarding: "yes"
      ...
    }
  }
  1: {
    criteria: "Group sftp-users"
    params: {
      AllowTcpForwarding: "yes"
      PermitRootLogin: "no"
      X11Forwarding: "no"
    }
  }
]
```
