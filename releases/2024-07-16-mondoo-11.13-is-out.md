## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Exceptions for vendor advisories

Exceptions can now be set on advisories, not just checks. To set an exception on an advisory navigate to the advisories page on your asset, and select the advisories you wish to snooze or disable.

For more information, [check out the documentation](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/security/customize/advisories/).

### Set scoring system per-policy

https://github.com/mondoohq/console/pull/4593

### Failing integration notification

Tokens may expire and accounts might change, but now you can quickly spot when integrations stop scanning as they should. Space owners will notice a new icon in the integrations menu whenever an issue arises. Plus, any failing integrations are highlighted on the integrations page, so you can identify the problem type at a glance without diving into each page.

#### Understand asset risk on policy check pages

https://github.com/mondoohq/console/pull/4544

### Create cases directly from policy check pages

Cases are a new feature of Mondoo that allow you to turn security findings into tasks to complete. They integrate with Atlassian Jira to fit into your existing workflow.

![Mondoo Case Management Screen](/img/releases/2024-07-09-mondoo-11.12-is-out/screenshot_cases.png)

When you see a security finding that requires fixing, you create a case for that finding. Mondoo automatically includes the details of the finding, information on the asset(s) that contain the finding, and instructions for fixing it. When you save the case, Mondoo automatically creates an issue containing all the same information in your Jira project.

To create cases from failing checks, simply open a check and click the 'Create Case' button to get started. You can also [check out the documentation](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/cases/overview/).

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Updated CIS Windows 10 / 11 benchmark policies

Secure Windows endpoints with the latest CIS Windows 10 and 11 benchmark policies version 3.0. This major version bump includes a large refactoring of the recommendations for securing Windows hosts including new and updated recommendations, improved descriptions / remediation text, and overall improvements to queries to ensure you always have the best output to work with.
