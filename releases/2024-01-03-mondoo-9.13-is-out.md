## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Scoping in Compliance Hub

New scoping in Compliance Hub gives you fine-grained management of which controls you report to your auditor. Is your auditor not requesting a particular control even though it's part of the compliance framework? Select the control in Compliance Hub and mark it out of scope. With scoping, you decide what to include in your audit without setting exceptions (which would appear in audit report PDFs).

### Check exceptions in Compliance Hub

Need more time to remediate findings for your audit? Now you can set exceptions on individual checks. Explanations let you communicate work to be done or identify compensating controls.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Improved vendor security advisory view

Redesigned vendor security advisory pages make it easier to understand the impact of an advisory and what actions you need to take next.
