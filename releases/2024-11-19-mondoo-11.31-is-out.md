## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Explore query packs results space-wide

Understand the configuration of systems throughout your spaces with query packs. Query pack pages now expose results returned for each asset. Use Mondoo's two dozen out-of-the-box query packs to expose important configuration data such as running processes or available memory. If those query packs don't include quite what you need, write your own query packs to expose business-specific asset configuration data throughout your spaces.

### New CIS NGINX benchmark policies

Keep critical web servers, proxy servers, and load balancers secure with new CIS NGINX benchmarks. These six policies include 91 checks in total designed to ensure that NGINX is not only installed securely but configured to protect sensitive data from prying eyes.

### Run Mondoo in Azure Cloud Shell

Secure your Azure subscriptions without complex Azure credential configuration. Now Mondoo can install and run directly in Azure Cloud Shell: Simply paste the Workstation Quick Setup command in Azure Cloud Shell.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Priority findings on the spaces page

Quickly understand the spaces that need your attention the most with a count of priority findings shown on the spaces page. The number of priority findings is the total of all critical and high findings on the space. Mondoo highlights them to help you to better prioritize your effort.

### Faster load times in compliance

Track your compliance quicker than ever, with up to 10x faster load times in the Compliance Frameworks page.

### Additional risk factors for FTP servers

Prioritize the risks that matter the most with new risk factors for assets running vsftp, Pure-FTPd, and ProFTPD FTP servers.
