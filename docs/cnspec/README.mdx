## Scan locally

Use the `cnspec scan` command to check local and remote targets for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. cnspec detects the target platform and runs policy checks specific to that system.

This command evaluates the security of your local machine:

```bash
cnspec scan local
```

This (truncated) sample result shows the individual checks that cnspec performs according to the policy. It includes a summary of the scan with a letter grade:

```
Checks:
✓ Pass:  Disable Media Sharing
✓ Pass:  Do not enable the "root" account
✓ Pass:  Disable Bluetooth Sharing
✕ Fail:  Enable security auditing
✓ Pass:  Enable Firewall
...
✕ Fail:  Ensure Firewall is configured to log
✓ Pass:  Ensure nfs server is not running.
✓ Pass:  Disable Content Caching
✕ Fail:  Ensure AirDrop Is Disabled
✓ Pass:  Control access to audit records

## Scan remote targets

You can also specify remote targets to scan.

This example scans a docker image:

```bash
cnspec scan docker image ubuntu:22.04
```

This scans an aws account using the local AWS configuration profile:

```bash
cnspec scan aws
```

This scans a Kubernetes cluster using your local kubectl config:

```bash
cnspec scan k8s
```

This scans a GitHub repository:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<personal_access_token>
cnspec scan github repo <org/repo>
```

## Create a JSON report

To save the results of your scan to a JSON file, append your scan command with the `-o` flag:

```
-o json > FILENAME.json
```

For `FILENAME`, substitute the name you want to give the file. For example, this scans a Kubernetes cluster and reports the results to a file named `k8s-test-results.json`:

```bash
cnspec scan k8s -o json > k8s-test-results.json
```
