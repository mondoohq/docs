## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### End of life status is now a risk factor

Better understand when assets are approaching end of life with a new, configurable end-of-life risk factor. This risk factor replaces the existing end-of-life policy and instead uses a configurable warning period and risk factors to expose high-risk EOL assets.

Set your desired warning period or turn off warnings entirely space wide:

Filter on EOL assets within affected asset pages:

### New Shodan and VMware inventory packs

Gather detailed information on more aspects of your infrastructure with new VMware and Shodan asset inventory packs. The VMware asset inventory pack gathers information on vCenter servers as well as individual ESXi hosts, so you can better understand the state of your clusters. The Shodan asset inventory pack gathers information on hosts assets using the Shodan service.

### Control cnspec output using an ENV variable

Control the command line output of cnspec using a new `MONDOO_OUTPUT` environmental variable that can be set in shell config files or in CI/CD jobs.

```bash
export MONDOO_OUTPUT=nodata,nocontrols
cnspec scan local
```
