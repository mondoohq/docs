ðŸŽ‰ FEATURES

**ðŸ¥³ Kubernetes API Support**

We adapted the current `k8s://` to target the Kubernetes API. This allows you to validate deployed applications. Mondoo ships with a new Kubernetes Application Benchmark. Just activate this benchmark in your Mondoo dashboard to scan for common pod configurations.

```bash
# mondoo will use kubectl context and setup
mondoo scan -t k8s://
```
