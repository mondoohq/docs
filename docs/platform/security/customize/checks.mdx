Make _exceptions_ in a policy to customize how Mondoo evaluates your assets. Exceptions tell Mondoo to exclude certain [checks](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/simple/#checks) when calculating your overall security posture.

If a policy contains some checks that don't apply to your space or that, for any reason, you don't want to include in your security assessments, you can _disable_ them. Doing so instructs Mondoo to skip them entirely. Mondoo doesn't track disabled checks, report their progress, or include them in your overall score.

To temporarily or indefinitely exclude a check from your overall results, you can _snooze_ it. While a check is snoozed, its failures don't affect your asset or space scores. Snoozing is useful when you intend to comply with a guideline eventually but don't want it distracting your team right now.

## Disable or snooze checks

:::note

Only team members who have Editor or Owner access to a space can snooze or disable checks in the space.

:::

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the space in which you want to disable a check.

   ![Space in the Mondoo Console](/img/platform/security/monitor-org.png)

2. In the side navigation bar, under **Security**, select **Policies**.

3. Select the policy you want to customize.

4. Select the **Checks** tab to see all the checks in the policy.

6. Select the **SET EXCEPTION** button.

7. Select whether to **Snooze** or **Disable** the check.

   If you select Snooze, select how long to snooze the check. Select **Indefinitely** to keep the check snoozed unless you un-snooze it.

8. Select the **SAVE EXCEPTION** button.

## Approve or reject an exception

Exceptions take effect the moment they're added. However, as an extra tracking step, a team member can approve or reject an exception:

- Approving an exception allows it to remain.

- Rejecting an exception removes it.

Only team members who have Editor or Owner access to a space can approve or reject exceptions in the space.

To approve or reject an exception:
