## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Show numeric asset scores in the CLI

Understand your precise scores in the cnspec CLI with new numeric score values in addition to A-F scores.

### Add specific vendor advisory sources

Jump right to the source with new direct links to vendor advisories on software advisory pages.

### Improved AWS integration troubleshooting

Failures happen, so let's get to the root cause faster with new troubleshooting options for AWS integrations. The ... menu in the AWS integrations pages now includes new options that:

- Force an update of the Lambda code powering the integration
- Send diagnostics logs directly to Mondoo

## Kubernetes scanning performance improvements

We introduced a new mechanism to reduce the number of calls made during asset discovery. This is especially helpful when scanning larger Kubernetes clusters. It lets cnquery and cnspec incrementally scan every asset one by one without having to scan all of them initially. This performance improvement not only drastically cuts the execution time, it also eliminates the need for reading container images twice from the system, cutting down on I/O load.

This improvement is automatically enabled for new workloads. We currently support it for container images and plan to extend it to other workloads with costly discovery steps in the future.
