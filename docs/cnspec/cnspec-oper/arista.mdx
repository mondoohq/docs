cnspec assesses your Arista EOS network devices for misconfigurations that put your organization at risk. You can use MQL to [write policies](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/) that define your Arista security standards. You also can write individual tests to run on the fly or include in automated tasks.

For a list of Arista EOS resources you can test, read [Arista EOS Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/arista-pack/), [Mondoo Operating Systems (OS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/os-pack/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core-pack/).

## Requirements

To test an Arista EOS asset with cnspec, you must have:

- [cnspec installed on your workstation](/cnspec/)
- Access to the device using the HTTPS API

## Configure the security group

Mondoo relies on the Arista API to scan an Arista EOS device. To give Mondoo the access it needs, modify the security group to include **HTTPS** access. One quick way to do this is to allow "All Traffic" from your IP address only.

## SSH to the device

Access the device using SSH. For DEVICE_PUBLIC_IP, substitute the public IP address of the device. For YOUR_KEY_PATH, substitute the path to your SSH key:

```bash
ssh ec2-user@DEVICE_PUBLIC_IP -i YOUR_KEY_PATH
```

For information on SSH key access to Arista devices, read [SSH login without password](https://arista.my.site.com/AristaCommunity/s/article/ssh-login-without-password) in the Arista community.

## Configure the host for scanning

Change the device configuration to allow cnspec to successfully scan it. For NEW_SECRET, substitute a password of your choice:

```bash
localhost> enable
localhost# config t
localhost(config)# username admin secret NEW_SECRET
localhost(config)# management api http-commands
localhost(config-mgmt-api-http-cmds)# no shutdown
localhost(config-mgmt-api-http-cmds)# copy run start
Copy completed successfully.
```

## Scan with cnspec

Use the `cnspec scan` command to scan the device. For DEVICE_PUBLIC_IP, substitute the device's public IP address:

```bash
cnspec scan arista DEVICE_PUBLIC_IP --ask-pass
```

Provide the password when prompted.

## Learn more

cnspec also provides an interactive shell in which you can explore. It helps you understand the checks that cnspec policies use, and write your own as well. Itâ€™s also a great way to interact with assets on the fly. To learn more, read [Create Checks in cnspec Shell](/cnspec/cnspec-scan/).

- To learn more about how the MQL query language works, read [Write Effective MQL](/mql/mql.write/).

- For a list of all the operating system resources and fields you can query, read the [Mondoo Operating Systems (OS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/os-pack/).

- To learn about cnspec commands, read:

  - [cnspec scan](/cnspec/cli/cnspec_scan/)

  - [cnspec shell](/cnspec/cli/cnspec_shell/)

  - [cnspec run](/cnspec/cli/cnspec_run/)
