## Update the Mondoo package for cnquery and cnspec

### Problem: When upgrading the Mondoo package, you get "Primary key is not live" errors

YUM and DNF can encounter this error when updating the Mondoo package on Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS, Rocky Linux, or AlmaLinux machines. It occurs when a long time has passed between updates and the signing GPG for the package has expired.

### Solution: Update GPG

```bash
rpm -q --qf "%{NAME}-%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}\t%{SUMMARY}\n" gpg-pubkey | sort -k 2
gpg-pubkey-00e1c42b-6005e7d7    Mondoo Inc <security@mondoo.com> public key

rpm -e gpg-pubkey-00e1c42b-6005e7d7

rpm --import https://releases.mondoo.com/rpm/pubkey.gpg
```

## Move servers and endpoints

### Problem: You need to move a server or endpoint to a different space

You might have added assets to Mondoo before developing a plan for your organization, or you might have changed your organization strategy.

### Solution: Unregister the asset and re-register it in the new space

#### For Linux-based assets:

1. Log into the asset and open a Linux root shell.

2. Unregister the asset:

```bash
cnspec logout --force
```

3. Open the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com).

4. [Navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the space where you want to move the asset.

5. In the left navigation, under **Integrations**, select **Add New Integration**.

6. Select your operating system.

7. Copy the registration token (the long, blue string in the text box).

8. Re-register the asset. For `COPIED-TOKEN`, substitute the registration token you copied:

```bash
cnspec login --token 'COPIED-TOKEN' --config '/etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml'
```

9. Run an initial cnspec scan to send the results to the new space:

   ```bash
   cnspec scan
   ```

#### For Windows assets:

1. Log into the asset and open PowerShell as an administrator.

2. Unregister the asset:

   ```powershell
   cnspec logout --force
   ```

3. Open the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com).

4. [Navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the space where you want to move the asset.

5. In the left navigation, under **Integrations**, select **Add New Integration**.

6. Select your operating system.

7. Copy the registration token (the long, blue string in the text box).

8. Re-register the asset. For `COPIED-TOKEN`, substitute the registration token you copied:

   ```powershell
   cnspec login --token 'COPIED-TOKEN' --config 'C:\ProgramData\Mondoo\mondoo.yml'
   ```

9. Run an initial cnspec scan to send the results to the new space:

   ```powershell
   cnspec scan
   ```
