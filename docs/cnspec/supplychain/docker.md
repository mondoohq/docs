Use cnspec to scan Docker images, containers, and Dockerfiles for security misconfigurations, CVEs, and end of life operating systems using the built in Mondoo security policies or your own custom policies.

## Dockerfiles

Scan Dockerfiles to reveal security issues before they reach production.

Scan a single Dockerfile, substituting the path a name of the file for FILEPATH:

```bash
cnquery scan docker file FILEPATH
```

Find nested Dockerfiles within a directory, substituting the directory path for PATH:

```bash
cnquery scan docker file PATH
```

## Docker images

Use cnspec to scan Docker images in public or private container registries using their registry name:

```bash
cnspec scan docker ubuntu:latest
cnspec scan docker elastic/elasticsearch:7.2.0
cnspec scan docker gcr.io/google-containers/ubuntu:22.04
cnspec scan docker registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi
```

If the Docker agent is installed, you can scan images by their id:

```bash
cnspec scan docker docker-image-id
```

## Docker containers

Scan a running or stopped Docker container by the container ID:

```bash
cnspec scan docker docker-container-id
```

:::note

You can only scan Docker containers if the Docker engine is installed.

## Manage cnspec providers for containers

_Providers_ are the components of cnspec that allow it to evaluate specific platforms. To learn how to manage cnspec providers most efficiently for containers, read [Manage cnspec Providers](/cnspec/cnspec-adv-install/providers/).
