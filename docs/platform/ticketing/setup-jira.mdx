Set up ticketing in a space to allow users in the space to keep track of security tasks and add Jira issues directly from within the Mondoo Console. Ticketing setup involves configuring Mondoo to integrate with Jira.

For an overview of ticketing, read [Track and Fix Findings with Ticketing](/platform/ticketing/overview/).

:::note

Mondoo offers an alternative method for sharing tickets with Jira: an email integration. This approach lets you tap into the automation features of [Jira's incoming mail handler](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/create-issues-and-comments-from-email/). To learn how to create an email integration for ticketing, read [Set up Ticketing to Email Your External Ticket System](/platform/ticketing/setup-email).

:::

## Prerequisites

- Owner or Editor access to the Mondoo space

- A Jira account with access to the project where you want Mondoo to add issues

- An API token for Jira account access

  To learn how to create and copy an API token, read [Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/) in the Atlassian documentation.
