description: Learn about Mondoo's versioning policy and how to make sure you have the latest release
---

Mondoo Platform is web-based SaaS, so you never need to upgrade to get the latest Mondoo Console and administrative software. However, [cnspec](/platform/infra/opsys/mondoo-cnspec/), Mondoo's CLI that powers some Mondoo integrations, is a binary that you manage on your assets.

:::note

You're responsible for updating cnspec across your infrastructure. To learn how, read [Update cnspec](/cnspec/cnspec-adv-install/update/).

## How Mondoo versioning works

Mondoo's versioning policy is _based on_ the semantic versioning standard. For example, in version 6.3.2, 6 is the major version, 3 is the minor version, and 2 is the patch. When we release a new version, we increment one of these three version components depending on the type of changes we introduce.

### Breaking changes

Major version releases of Mondoo contain _soft-breaking_ changes. These may require you to update your integrations, policies, or automation scripts in order to avoid disruption, but you have a long time to make those updates. We provide advanced warning before we make these changes, and they don't become _hard-breaking_ changes until the next major release.
