## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Zero in on exactly the assets you need with workspaces

Do you find yourself repeatedly searching for the same groups of assets? Do you wish you could see a subgroup of assets in your space to compare them or measure progress on a certain project? Or maybe some assets just get in the way of what you want to focus on right now? What you need are workspaces!

![Lists of workspaces](/img/releases/2025-01-07-mondoo-11.36-is-out/workspaces_list.png)

Workspaces are dynamic groups of assets in a space that you want to view and assess together. Unlike spaces; assets are grouped based on queries and best of all an asset can be in as many workspaces as you want. Create a workspace that shows only assets with critical findings, another workspace that has all your Windows 2016 systems that still need to be upgraded, and another that includes all the systems owned by the Frontend team... whatever meets your specific business needs.

**How might you use workspaces to solve problems?**

Like many companies, Lunalectric has thousands of assets, but recently their CISO has been increasingly focused on their supply chain. To ensure GitHub and GitLab source code and CI/CD configuration meet best practices, let's create a workspace just for these SCM assets.

![Creating a workspaces filter](/img/releases/2025-01-07-mondoo-11.36-is-out/workspaces_filter.png)

We'll create a single asset selection that matches on the different asset platforms for GitHub and GitLab. Asset selections can match on asset name, kind, platform, platform version, and risk rating with more options coming soon. You can add additional conditions to your selection and build as many selections as you want allow you to create complex queries like Windows systems with a critical risk rating that aren't Windows 2022 and have the word "luna" in the asset name.

Once our workspace is created we can find it from the workspaces in the left nav bar or from a new workspaces top navigation drop down menu.

![Workspaces in the top navigation](/img/releases/2025-01-07-mondoo-11.36-is-out/nav_bar.png)

Once in our new SCM Assets workspace, things will feel similar to the existing Lunalectric spaces, but focused on understanding risks and exploring assets. Our workspaces dashboard is shows just our GitLab and GitHub assets including the top misconfigurations we should start tackling. We can dive into policies, checks, CVES, or advisories to see more details but everything will stay tightly focused on the problem at hand.

Before diving deeper in the console, our dashboard's inventory overview is telling quite the story. GitLab assets are all passing checks, but GitHub assets on the other hand are all high risk.

![GitHub assets](/img/releases/2025-01-07-mondoo-11.36-is-out/github_assets.png)

Armed with this quite insight, we have the information we need to let our CISO know the current SCM risk and to develop a remediation plan to secure these critical assets.

To learn how you can use workspaces to better organize assets and expose risks see our [Plan Your Mondoo Organization](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/start/organize/overview/) and [Workspaces](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/start/organize/workspaces/) documentation.

### Quick access to reports

Quickly access compliance reports from the Reporting page in the navigation menu. Looking for more reports? Stay tuned for more updates in upcoming releases and if you're looking for something in particular let us know at [product@mondoo.com](mailto:product@mondoo.com)!

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Optionally follow HTTP -> HTTPS redirects

You now have additional control over how HTTP hosts are scanned in the `host` provider. By default cnquery/cnspec will no longer follow redirects from HTTP to HTTPS endpoints so you can inspect your HTTP configurations when specified. If you'd prefer to follow any redirects use the new `--follow-redirects` flag.

Without the redirect you'll be able to inspect the original page and headers:

```shell
$ cnquery shell host http://mondoo.com

cnquery> http.get
http.get: http.get url=url id = http://mondoo.com statusCode=301
cnquery> http.get.body
http.get.body: ""
```

With redirects specified you can follow all redirects to the final page users would see:

```shell
$ cnquery shell host --follow-redirects http://mondoo.com

cnquery> http.get
http.get: http.get url=url id = http://mondoo.com statusCode=200
cnquery> http.get.body
http.get.body: "<!DOCTYPE html><!-- Last Published: Fri Jan 10 2025 00:09:49 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time) --><html..."
```

### Improved CIS Benchmarks

Sometimes the best changes are behind the scenes. This week we shipped all new internal tooling to generate CIS benchmark policies in Mondoo Platform. Not only will these changes allow us to bring you the latest and greatest policies more quickly in the future, they also allowed us to make a huge number of small improvements to existing policies:

- New checks that were previously marked as requiring manual user validation
- More clear and concise descriptions for each policy
- Expanded check descriptions including rational behind the security concerns
- New audit and remediation steps in many Linux distribution policies
- Simplified MQL queries to improve readability
- Additional platform version tags to improve searching for policies
- Improve policy search results when searching for platform versions

### Quickly find integrations

Find the right integration with less scrolling. The add integration page now supports search based on integration categories in addition to integration names.
