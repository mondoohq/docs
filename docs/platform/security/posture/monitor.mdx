Mondoo provides continuous security monitoring of the assets in your digital infrastructure. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), you can always see up-to-date scan results for all the assets registered with your account.

The **Organization Overview**, **Dashboard**, and **Security Overview** in the Mondoo Console provide many ways to monitor your overall infrastructure security. From these pages, you can drill down into the security of individual assets and learn about the individual findings on those assets.

## Assess your security posture

The **Dashboard** of a space gives you a quick understanding of your security posture. To access a space's dashboard:

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the organization containing the space you want to view.

   ![Monitor organization security in the Mondoo Console](/img/platform/security/org-overview.png)

   The Organization Overview shows trends in your security scores and important vulnerability information.

2. In the side navigation bar, select **Spaces**.

   ![Spaces in the Mondoo Console](/img/platform/security/spaces.png)

3. To view security for a space, select the box representing the space.

   ![Space dashboard in the Mondoo Console](/img/platform/security/dashboard.png)

   The upper portion of the space dashboard shows the most important information about the space:

   - An interactive chart of all the types of assets in the space and their risks

   - The number of critical- and high-risk findings in the space

   - A list of the most important findings that need to be fixed

   ![Space dashboard in the Mondoo Console](/img/platform/security/dashboard-bottom.png)

   The lower portion of the space dashboard shows remediation statistics and finding details:

   - Your team's performance on remediating risk, including measurement against your service level agreement (SLA) and the mean time to remediate (MTTR) findings, grouped by risk level

   - Vulnerability counts broken down by type of finding (advisories and CVEs)

   - An overview of enabled policies

   To learn how Mondoo ranks the top vulnerabilities and findings, read [Prioritize Security Findings](/platform/security/posture/findings/).

   :::tip

   You can also select a [workspace](/platform/start/organize/workspaces/) to view a subset of assets within a space.

4. Use the interactive chart to explore the space:

   - The main, inside circle shows the distribution of types of assets in the space.

     Hover over a section to see the distribution of security scores in that section.

     {" "}

     <img src={fidget1} width="500" />

   - The outer circle shows subsections of assets in the space.

     Hover over a subsection to see the distribution of security scores in that subsection.

     {" "}

     <img src={fidget2} width="500" />

   - Select a section to zoom into the chart and see details of the section. To zoom back out, select the center of the chart.

   - To see a list of all assets in the current chart view, select **VIEW AS LIST**. From that list, you can select an asset to see its detailed security information.

## Find an asset's security details in the Inventory view

Another way to access an asset's security details is via the **Inventory** view.

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the organization containing the space you want to view.

2. In the side navigation bar, select **Spaces**.

   ![Monitor organization security in the Mondoo Console](/img/platform/security/spaces.png)

3. Select the box representing the space you want to drill into.

4. In the left navigation, under **Inventory**, select **All Assets**.

5. Filter the list of assets:

   - If there are multiple types of assets in the space, you can select a type to show only assets of that type. For example, select AWS to show only AWS assets. To stop filtering by integration type, select the integration type again.

   - To filter by account, namespace, or configuration keywords, type the word or part of the word in the search box.

     ![Filter assets in the Mondoo Console](/img/platform/security/monitor-filter.png)

   - To remove a filter, select the **x** next to the filter.

6. To see details on an asset's most recent security scan, select the asset.

### Choose asset details to view

The tabs on the asset detail page show different details:
