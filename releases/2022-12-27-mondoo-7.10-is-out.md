## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### New GCP GKE resource

**Problem:** You've secured your Kubernetes workloads and kubelet configs with Mondoo and NSA Kubernetes security policies, but you need to secure your GKE cluster configuration as well.

**Solution:** A new `gcp.project.clusters` resource lets you explore your GKE clusters and write policies to secure your cluster control plane.

```coffeescript
cnquery> gcp.project.clusters { * }
gcp.project.clusters: [
  0: {
    resourceLabels: {}
    name: "luna-gke-cluster-2"
    projectId: "luna-edge"
    locations: [
      0: "us-central1-b"
      1: "us-central1-c"
      2: "us-central1-f"
    ]
    created: 2022-12-15 20:43:41 +0000 +0000
    status: "RUNNING"
    zone: "us-central1"
    description: ""
    nodePools: [
  0: gcp.project.cluster.nodepool name="generic-pool"
    ]
    loggingService: "logging.googleapis.com/kubernetes"
    expirationTime: null
    enableKubernetesAlpha: false
    initialClusterVersion: "1.24.5-gke.600"
    network: "luna-gke-cluster-2"
    clusterIpv4Cidr: "10.20.0.0/16"
    autopilotEnabled: false
    endpoint: "63.192.209.236"
    currentMasterVersion: "1.24.5-gke.600"
    id: "123abcbcada644fcb3b83c30ea0efcfc3cd6d8f42a814bccbcb3503181e12b5a"
    subnetwork: "luna-gke-cluster-2-subnet"
    monitoringService: "monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes"
  }
]
```

### Examine Kubernetes Ingress certificates

**Problem:** You've secured your Kubernetes Ingresses with the new `k8s.ingress` resource, but you need to examine and secure the certificates associated with those Ingresses as well.

**Solution:** A new `k8s.ingress.certificates` resource allows you to explore and secure certificates associated with Kubernetes Ingress objects.

```coffeescript
$ ./cnquery run k8s --discover ingresses -c
'k8s.ingress.certificates{ expiresIn }'
‚Üí discover related assets for 1 asset(s)
‚Üí use cluster name from kube config cluster-name=minikube
‚Üí resolved assets resolved-assets=1
k8s.ingress.certificates: [
  0: {
    expiresIn: 12 days 2 hours 12 minutes 14 seconds
  }
]
```

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Continued migration to cnspec

Our migration from the legacy Mondoo CLI to cnspec continues this week with CI and Kubernetes. CI integration examples in the console now show simpler cnspec steps, and the Mondoo Kubernetes Operator uses the new cnspec container images for all cluster scans. Stay tuned as we continue to migrate to our improved open source cnspec CLI over the coming weeks.

### See errors from the Kubernetes operator

Kubernetes integration pages show any errors reported by the Mondoo Kubernetes Operator so you can more easily troubleshoot operator failures.

### Improved help descriptions

cnspec and cnquery now include improved help and resource descriptions: We've improved many command descriptions to help new users, added descriptions for many resources, and removed some invalid resources that were showing up in auto-complete in the cnquery/cnspec shells.

## üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Fix MachineType error in `gcp.compute.instances` resource.
- Fix integer comparisons in MQL failing when resources returned a 32-bit integer instead of the assumed 64-bit integer.
- Allow users to navigate the console tabs with the keyboard.
- Allow users to upload policies that use alternative YAML MIME types to the Policy Hub.
- Fix errors in `Ensure default user umask is 027 or more restrictive` and `Ensure default user umask is configured` controls within Mondoo and CIS Linux policies.
