## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Create Azure DevOps issues from Mondoo

Mondoo now supports creating remediation tickets in Azure DevOps. This option joins our existing support for ticketing with Jira, Zendesk, GitHub, GitLab, and email.

Mondoo users can create tickets in these external systems and update them as it detects changes. When all the findings are remediated, Mondoo can automatically close tickets. When previously resolved findings regress, Mondoo can automatically open new cases to track remediation.

### Policy scoring weight configuration

Configure how Mondoo scores your policies with a newly redesigned policies page. The new policies page makes it easier to enable or disable a policy, share that policy with colleagues, and now to modify how that policy is scored. Select the scale icon from the top of any policies page to display five new scoring options.
