## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Microsoft Defender for Cloud findings in Mondoo

Mondoo now imports vulnerabilities discovered by Microsoft Defender for Cloud, so you can prioritize them alongside vulnerabilities discovered by Mondoo. Mondoo helps security teams quickly make sense of security findings regardless of where those findings originate, prioritize the most critical risks, and easily assign them to IT and DevOps with detailed remediation steps. This means that Mondoo significantly speeds up time to resolution and bolsters overall security posture.

Vulnerabilities discovered by Microsoft Defender for Cloud appear in the Mondoo console alongside those discovered by Mondoo‚Äôs own scans. Mondoo automatically enriches all vulnerabilities found by Microsoft Defender with additional risk data and remediation advice, and prioritizes them based on the actual risk posed in the environment.

Mondoo enriches the findings generated by Microsoft Defender for Cloud with severity, known exploit data, exploit prediction scoring, asset exposure, and business impact, to make sure your security teams are focused on resolving the most important problems.

### Network security with Nmap scanning

Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is a powerful and versatile open source tool used for network discovery and security auditing. Network administrators, security professionals, and penetration testers rely on Nmap to map out network structures, discover hosts, identify services, and detect vulnerabilities. Now you can integrate Nmap results with Mondoo findings using our new cnquery/cnspec Nmap provider.

Scan active IP address in a network:

```coffee
nmap.network("192.168.178.0/24").hosts { name ports { * }  }
nmap.network.hosts: [
  0: {
    ports: [
      0: {
        service: "http"
        version: ""
        method: "probed"
        state: "open"
        protocol: "tcp"
        port: 443
        product: "FRITZ!Box http config"
      }
      1: {
        service: "sip"
        version: ""
        method: "probed"
        state: "open"
        protocol: "tcp"
        port: 5060
        product: "AVM FRITZ!OS SIP"
      }
    ]
    name: "192.168.178.1"
  }
  1: {
    ports: [
      0: {
        service: "rtsp"
        version: "770.8.1"
        method: "probed"
        state: "open"
        protocol: "tcp"
        port: 5000
        product: "AirTunes rtspd"
      }
      1: {
        service: "rtsp"
        version: "770.8.1"
        method: "probed"
        state: "open"
        protocol: "tcp"
        port: 7000
        product: "AirTunes rtspd"
      }
    ]
    name: "192.168.178.25"
  }
]
```

Scan a specific host IP:

```coffee
nmap.network(target: "192.168.178.25").hosts { ports }
nmap.network.hosts: [
  0: {
    ports: [
      0: nmap.port port=5000 service="rtsp"
      1: nmap.port port=7000 service="rtsp"
    ]
  }
]
```

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Performance improvements

No one wants to wait so we made Mondoo faster than ever.

- 4x faster compliance report generation
- 7x faster asset discovery during large scans
- 20x faster GitHub repository discovery in large organizations
- Reduced GitHub API call usage during organization scans

### New checks in Mondoo DNS Security

The Mondoo DNS Security policy now includes full descriptions and impact scores for each check. There are also new checks to ensure DNSSEC is enabled and no DNS wildcard entries exist.

### Display remediated asset count on CVEs

It's important to observe not just the current state of CVEs, but also the work you've done to resolve them. Remediated counts on CVE and advisory pages provide the full scope of information.
