This quick setup for a single Azure subscription provides efficient command line instructions to efficiently integrate an Azure subscription with Mondoo. We recommend this approach for most users.

:::note

These instructions describe how to use Microsoft's "automated" method of registering an Azure app. If you want to use your own certificates for authentication, if you use the [_key vault access policy_ permission model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-access-policy), or if your Azure environment is unusually large, follow the instructions in [Manually Set up an Azure Integration](/platform/infra/cloud/azure/manual-reg-path/) instead.

:::

## Before you begin

Before you integrate Microsoft Azure with Mondoo, be sure you have:

- A [Mondoo account](/platform/start/plat-start-acct/) with Editor or Owner permissions for the space in which you want to add the integration.

- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) with an active subscription and permission to manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Active Directory). Any of these [Entra built-in roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) include the required permissions:

  - [Global Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator)

  - [Application administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator)

  - [Cloud application administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator)

  In the Azure portal you can see what roles your user account has: Go to **Microsoft Entra ID > Users > (your user account) > Assigned roles**.

- Command-line access to Azure using either:

  - [Azure Cloud Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart?tabs=azurecli)

  - <details>
      <summary>
        The Azure CLI in either the Linux shell or the macOS shell
      </summary>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">
              Install the Azure CLI.
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Log into the Azure CLI from PowerShell or a Linux/macOS CLI by
            entering:
            <br />
            <tt>az login</tt>
            <br />
            Azure opens your web browser and prompts you to log in. After you do
            so, you can return to the CLI.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </details>

## Quick setup steps

Like every service that integrates with Azure, Mondoo must have Microsoft Entra ID app registration and service principal. To learn more about creating a new app registration and service principal, read [App registration, app objects, and service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal#app-registration-app-objects-and-service-principals) in the Entra documentation.

Registering Mondoo with Entra establishes a trust relationship between Mondoo and the Microsoft identity platform. The trust is unidirectional: Mondoo trusts the Microsoft identity platform, and not the other way around. The Entra app registration creates a [service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/how-applications-are-added#what-are-service-principals-and-where-do-they-come-from){:target="\_blank"} to represent Mondoo in any tenants and subscriptions.

The app registration you create gives Mondoo read-only access to Azure resources, web apps, key vaults, and Graph API.

To configure your Azure resources, you must:

- Step A, retrieve the subscription ID.

- Step B, create the app registration and certificate and grant READ access.

- Step C, grant web app and key vault READ permissions to the registered app.

- Step D, grant permissions to access Microsoft Graph (API permissions).

For the final setup step, Step E, you add the integration in Mondoo.
