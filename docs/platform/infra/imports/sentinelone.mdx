Mondoo can import data from SentinelOne and incorporate that data with your security findings. With a unified view of SentinelOne's vulnerabilities and Mondoo scan results, you can take advantage of Mondoo's powerful security visualization, prioritization, and ticket system integration.

## Prerequisites

Before you integrate SentinelOne with Mondoo, be sure you have:

- A Mondoo account with Editor or Owner permissions for the space in which you want to add the integration

- A [SentinelOne account](??????) with DEETS

- access DEETS


## Integrate Mondoo with SentinelOne

To create a new SentinelOne integration in Mondoo, perform these steps:

Step A: Create a SentinelOne DEETS to give Mondoo access to SentinelOne data

Step B: Add a new SentinelOne integration in the Mondoo Console

### Step A: Create a SentinelOne DEETS

Like any service that integrates with SentinelOne, Mondoo must have a DEETS that gives it access to SentinelOne data. To learn about DEETS

1. Log into the SentinelOne console as a DEETS.

2.

### Step B: Add a new SentinelOne integration in the Mondoo Console

After you've created your new API client, you can create a Mondoo SentinelOne integration. You need information from the DEETS you created in the instructions above.

1. Access the Integrations > Add > SentinelOne page in one of two ways:

   - New space setup: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **SentinelOne**.

   - INTEGRATIONS page: In the side navigation bar, under **INTEGRATIONS**, select **Add New Integration**. Under Third-Party Data, select **SentinelOne**.

2. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration.

3. DEETS

7. Select the **START IMPORTING** button.

Mondoo begins connecting to DEETS and collecting data.

## View, edit, or remove a SentinelOne integration

1. In the left navigation, under **Integrations**, select **All Integrations**.

2. Select **SentinelOne** and then select the integration you want.

3. Use the options in near the top-right corner of the page:

   - To change the integration settings, select the edit (pencil) icon.

   - To import data from SentinelOne as soon as possible, select the **SCHEDULE NOW** button.

   - To pause or resume importing data from SentinelOne, select the ellipsis (...) menu and then select Pause Imports or Resume Imports.

   - To remove the integration, select the delete (trash can) icon.
