## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Summary Scan Output

**Problem:** Mondoo scans print all results for every query in the CLI. However, sometimes users just want to see a quick summary of how the scan went, especially when it's collected upstream for a deeper analysis.

**Solution:** Mondoo now includes a new summary output mode. This mode contains just the summary portion of the Mondoo scan so you can quickly determine the security posture of systems.

### NSA PowerShell Policy

**Problem:** Mondoo has always provided comprehensive resources for Microsoft PowerShell, but we never shipped a policy for its security best practices. This forced users to research, author, and maintain their own PowerShell policies.

**Solution:** Mondoo includes a new PowerShell security policy `NSA PowerShell: Security Measures to Use and Embrace`. This policy implements the recommendations of the United States, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom cybersecurity agency's whitepaper [Keeping PowerShell: Security Measures to Use and Embrace](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Jun/22/2003021689/-1/-1/1/CSI_KEEPING_POWERSHELL_SECURITY_MEASURES_TO_USE_AND_EMBRACE_20220622.PDF).

### Time Synchronization Policy

**Problem:** You want to ensure accurate time across systems within your organization for authentication and logging purposes.

**Solution:** Mondoo now includes a new `Operational Best Practices for Time Synchronization by Mondoo` policy for macOS, Linux, and Windows hosts to ensure that systems are correctly syncing their time.

### Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) Policy

**Problem:** You want to secure your Debian- and Red Hat-based Linux systems according to the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and pass a BSI audit.

**Solution:** Mondoo now includes a new `BSI SYS.1.3 Linux and Unix Servers by Mondoo` policy. BSI is a German standard for IT security, similar to SOC2 in the US. We are releasing this first policy with support for Debian- and Red Hat-based Linux to ensure that systems are correctly hardened according to the BSI requirements. This is especially helpful for users in the DACH region overall and Germany in particular.

### macOS Ventura (13) support

**Problem:** Apple is currently working on the next major version of its Mac operating system: macOS Ventura (release 13). It is slated for a release towards the end of this year. An early version of this new release is now available in beta and can be used today. However, the Mondoo baseline policy did not support it yet.

**Solution:** Mondoo Client has been tested on macOS Ventura beta and the `macOS Security Baseline by Mondoo` policy has been updated for this upcoming release.

### New Kubernetes MQL Resources

**Solution:** Mondoo now includes new [StatefulSet](/mql/resources/k8s-pack/k8s.statefulset/) and [ReplicaSet](/mql/resources/k8s-pack/k8s.replicaset/) resources so you can write policies for these resource types.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Improved Linux Policies

**Solution:** Mondoo's Linux Baseline policy and various CIS Linux policies have been updated for improved reliability and to better secure your systems:

- New: `Ensure sudo logging is enabled` control added to Mondoo Linux Security Baseline
- Bugfix: `Ensure SSH access is limited` now passes if SSH access is limited using only `AllowUsers`/`AllowGroups`
- Bugfix: Failures running `Ensure all GIDs in /etc/passwd exist in /etc/group` have been resolved
- Bugfix: Improved reliability in `Ensure that strong Key Exchange algorithms are used` and `Ensure only strong MAC algorithms are used` control
- Improved: Impact scores added to many controls
- Improved: `Ensure permissions on bootloader config are configured` control now checks that the file is owned by root/root
- Improved: `Ensure permissions on /etc/motd are configured` control now checks that the file is owned by root/root
- Improved: `Ensure permissions on /etc/issue are configured` control now checks that the file is owned by root/root
- Improved: `Ensure permissions on /etc/issue.net are configured` control now checks that the file is owned by root/root
- Improved: `Ensure permissions on all log files are configured` now shows which log files do not have the proper permission in the output
- Bugfix: Fix errors running `Ensure automatic mounting of removable media is disabled`
- Bugfix: Improved compatibility with Debian in `Ensure access to the su command is restricted`
- Improved: `Define the hardened ciphers for all SSH configurations` control now better runs on RHEL-derivative distros
- Bugfix: Improved compatibility with Debian/Ubuntu in `Define the hardened ciphers for all SSH configurations`
- Improved: `Ensure permissions on all log files are configured` now includes remediation steps to ensure future log files have the correct permissions
- Improved: `Ensure SSH root login is disabled` control now allows `prohibit-password` value
- Improved: Improved compatibility with Arch Linux derivatives
- Bugfix: Fix false positives in `Ensure journald is configured to compress large log files` control

### Improved K8s Application Policy

**Problem:** Your Kubernetes workloads include not just Pods, but many other kinds of Kubernetes resources. Mondoo's Kubernetes Application Benchmark scans only Pods, missing the root cause of many security misconfigurations.

**Solution:** The `Kubernetes Application Benchmark by Mondoo` now scans not just `Pods`, but also `StatefulSets`, `DaemonSets`, `Jobs`, `CronJobs`, and `Deployments`, ensuring all the resources on your cluster are secured. With these additional queries and expanded audit instructions in the policy, you can more easily find the parent resource with the identified misconfiguration, saving you time securing your cluster.

### Improved Kubernetes Operator

**Solution:** The Mondoo Operator for Kubernetes has been improved to increase the security and performance of scanning. The operator now runs all Mondoo Client containers without root privileges for increased security. The operator's admission controller also now runs scans ~30% faster, while reducing memory consumption in the cluster.

## 🐛 BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Resolves inconsistent results when scanning Kubernetes manifests using `mondoo scan` vs. Mondoo Operator admission controller scans
- Resolves failures running scans on Windows systems with the system language set to German
- Resolves failures scanning Azure when the current stack is not set
- Resolves two failures in MQL that could result in inconsistent or incorrect results
- Provide user friendly error messages when scanning container images in private registries
- Improved readability within policy results
- Wrap long asset names in the fleet view and the asset pages
