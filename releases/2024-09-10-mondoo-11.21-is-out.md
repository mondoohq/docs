## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Risk summaries for software

Quickly understand the risk of software versions deployed throughout your infrastructure with new risk summary boxes on software pages. The risk, CVSS score, EPSS score, risk factors, and blast radius help you make informed decisions when it comes to prioritizing software updates in your infrastructure.

### Discover advisories for CVEs

CVE pages now show whether the CVE has a related advisory. Now you can dive deeper into specific vendor recommendations when evaluating the impact of CVEs on your infrastructure.
