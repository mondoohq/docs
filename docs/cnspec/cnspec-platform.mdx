You can expand your cnspec capabilities with a Mondoo Platform account. Mondoo Platform includes a web-based UI through which you can:

- Continuously monitor infrastructure security and compliance
- Save, review, search, and share scan results
- Access over 200 free security policies, including specific compliance checks against regional and industry guidelines
- Manage and share policies across your entire infrastructure
- See the relationships between different assets in your infrastructure
- Integrate with AWS Lambda, EBS volume scans, Kubernetes controller, and more

This is just a partial list of capabilities. To learn more about what you can accomplish with Mondoo Platform, visit [mondoo.com](https://mondoo.com).

To get started, [contact Mondoo](https://mondoo.com/contact).

3. Select your operating system and then copy the commands in the box below.

4. In a terminal window, paste and run the copied commands.

cnspec is now registered with Mondoo Platform. The next time you scan your infrastructure with cnspec, you can see the results in the Mondoo Console.

To learn about working in the Mondoo Console, see the [Mondoo Platform documentation](/platform/home/).

## Specify a proxy server for communication with Mondoo

You can specify a proxy server for communication between cnspec and Mondoo Platform. This is useful if your default system proxy restricts communication, or if you need to monitor different types of traffic.

1. Find the Mondoo configuration file: `/etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml`.

2. Add this line to `mondoo.yml`:

   ```yaml
   api_proxy: https://1.1.1.1:8080
   ```
