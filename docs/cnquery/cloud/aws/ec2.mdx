Now that you have an introduction to [querying your AWS account](/cnquery/cloud/aws/account/) with cnquery, let's dive deeper and explore EC2 instances.

We'll continue working in the cnquery shell, which makes running individual queries easy. If it's not already open, enter `cnquery shell aws` in your terminal. To learn about accessing your AWS account with cnquery, read [Query AWS Infrastructure](/cnquery/cloud/aws/).

## EC2 resources

To launch a shell into your AWS environment, enter:

```bash
cnquery shell aws
```

Once you're in the shell, cnquery provides answers to any question about your EC2 instances. To discover all the resources and fields you can query, read [aws.ec2](/mql/resources/aws-pack/aws.ec2/). You can also use the `help` command in the shell:

```coffeescript
help aws.ec2
```

In this tutorial we'll explore just a few of the possibilities.

## Run simple queries on EC2 instances

This query gathers all your EC2 instances:

```coffeescript
aws.ec2.instances
```

It returns information on all your EC2 instances, including their ID, type, and state:

```coffeescript
aws.ec2.instances: [
  0: aws.ec2.instance instanceId="i-0684b0bfd6464a123" region="us-east-1" state="running" instanceType="t2.large" architecture="x86_64" platformDetails="Linux/UNIX"
  1: aws.ec2.instance instanceId="i-0568d8a10045a2456" region="us-east-1" state="running" instanceType="t3.small" architecture="x86_64" platformDetails="Linux/UNIX"
  2: aws.ec2.instance instanceId="i-037bfef314c57789" region="us-east-1" state="running" instanceType="t3.small" architecture="x86_64" platformDetails="Linux/UNIX"
  3: aws.ec2.instance instanceId="i-028f66fe019847abc" region="us-east-1" state="running" instanceType="m3.medium" architecture="x86_64" platformDetails="Windows"
  4: aws.ec2.instance instanceId="i-0f6e7f42454f4cdef" region="us-east-1" state="running" instanceType="t3.small" architecture="x86_64" platformDetails="Linux/UNIX"
]
```

## Specify fields to include in results

You can request specific data by including the field names. For example, this query collects the ARN and any assigned tags for each instance:

```coffeescript
aws.ec2.instances { arn tags }
```

It returns a list with only the information you asked for:

```coffeescript
aws.ec2.instances: [
  0: {
    tags: {
      Name: "k8s-operator01"
      owner: "suki@lunalectric.com"
    }
    arn: "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:921877552404:instance/i-06e2eaa19a4fa883e"
  }
  1: {
    tags: {
      Name: "vm-with-ebs-iam-role"
    }
    arn: "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:921877552404:instance/i-0facc86d89af823af"
  }
  2: {
    tags: {
      Name: "amazonlinux2-for-ebs-volume-scan"
      owner: "kembe@lunalectric.com"
    }
    arn: "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:921877552404:instance/i-0b24443c8d18fdbab"
  }
  3: {
    tags: {}
    arn: "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-1:921877552404:instance/i-020eed3b1e4965d8d"
  }
  4: {
    tags: {
      Name: "amos-linux"
    }
    arn: "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-1:921877552404:instance/i-08f2ba2424027454a"
  }
]
```

## Filter results

You can filter results based on any fields. Specify the criteria using the `where` function and standard boolean operators.

For example, this query requests only EC2 instances that do not have an `owner` tag:

```coffeescript
aws.ec2.instances.where(tags['owner'] == null)
```

It lists each instance's ARN and status:

```coffeescript
aws.ec2.instances.where: [
  0: aws.ec2.instance instanceId="i-0684b0bfd6464a123" region="us-east-1" state="running" instanceType="t2.large" architecture="x86_64" platformDetails="Linux/UNIX"
  1: aws.ec2.instance instanceId="i-0568d8a10045a2456" region="us-east-1" state="running" instanceType="t3.small" architecture="x86_64" platformDetails="Linux/UNIX"
  2: aws.ec2.instance instanceId="i-037bfef314c57789" region="us-east-1" state="running" instanceType="t3.small" architecture="x86_64" platformDetails="Linux/UNIX"
  3: aws.ec2.instance instanceId="i-028f66fe019847abc" region="us-east-1" state="running" instanceType="m3.medium" architecture="x86_64" platformDetails="Windows"
]
```

This finds large (more expensive) EC2 instances:

```coffeescript
aws.ec2.instances.where(instanceType == /^.*.large$/) { arn instanceType }
```

It returns a list of all instances that have an `instanceType` with `large` in the name.

This similar query finds T-type instances (such as T2, or T4g):

```coffeescript
aws.ec2.instances.where(instanceType == /^[t].*/) { instanceType }
```
