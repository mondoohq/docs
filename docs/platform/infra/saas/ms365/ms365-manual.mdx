## Prerequisites

Before you integrate Microsoft 365 with Mondoo, be sure you:

- Have a Mondoo account with Editor or Owner permissions for the space in which you want to add the integration.

- Have an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) with an active subscription and permission to manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Active Directory). Any of these [Microsoft Entra ID roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) include the required permissions:

  - [Global Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator) - Create and manage all aspects of app registrations and enterprise apps.

  - [Application administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator) - Create and manage all aspects of app registrations and enterprise apps.

  - [Cloud application administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator) - Create and manage all aspects of app registrations and enterprise apps except App Proxy.

- Are logged into Azure using the Azure CLI.

  - If you use the Azure Cloud Shell, you don't need to also log into the Azure CLI. To learn more, read the [Quick start for Azure Cloud Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart?tabs=azurecli).

  - If you use a Linux shell or macOS shell, log into the Azure CLI.

  <details>
    <summary>If you're not already an Azure CLI user: </summary>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">
            Install the Azure CLI.
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Log into the Azure CLI from PowerShell or a Linux/macOS CLI by
          entering:
          <br />
          <tt>az login --allow-no-subscriptions</tt>
          <br />
          Azure opens your web browser and prompts you to log in. After you do
          so, you can return to the CLI.

## Register an Azure app

Continuous scanning of Microsoft 365 requires a Microsoft Entra ID app registration in your Azure tenant. Registering Mondoo with Azure establishes a trust relationship between Mondoo and the Microsoft identity platform. The trust is unidirectional: Mondoo trusts the Microsoft identity platform, and not the other way around. The Azure app registration creates a [service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-how-applications-are-added#what-are-service-principals-and-where-do-they-come-from) to represent Mondoo in any tenants and subscriptions in which it acts.### Manual app registration option

To configure your Azure resources, you must:

Step A: Register an app with Azure and create a service principal

Step B: Grant permissions to access Microsoft Graph (API permissions)

Step C: Assign the Global Reader role

Step D: Upload the application certificate

### Step A: Register an app with Azure and create a service principal

Like any service that integrates with Azure, Mondoo must have an app registration. To learn more about creating a new app registration, read [App registration, app objects, and service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#app-registration-app-objects-and-service-principals) in the Azure documentation.

1. Log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as a global administrator, application administrator or cloud application administrator.

2. Find and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

3. In the navigation sidebar, select **App registrations**.

![Azure app registrations](/img/platform/infra/cloud/azure/app-regs.png)

4. Select **+ New registration**.

![create a new app registration in Azure](/img/platform/infra/cloud/azure/new-app-reg.png)

5. Enter the application name `mondoo-ms365` and select **Accounts in this organizational directory only** as the supported account type. Mondoo does not require an application redirect URI.

6. Select the **Register** button.

Microsoft creates the application ID and displays it in the application registration overview.

![new app registration in Azure](/img/platform/infra/cloud/azure/after-new-app-reg.png)

Keep this page open as you continue to the next step.

### Step B: Grant permissions to access Microsoft Graph (API permissions)

import Graph from "./_include-graph.mdx";

<Graph />{" "}

### Step C: Assign the Global Reader" role

1. In the Entra ID portal, go to **Identity (Roles & admins)**.

2. Use the search box to find the Global Reader role. Select the name of the role (not the check box). THe Assignments page opens.

3. Select **+ Add assignments**.

4. Find and select the newly created app, **mondoo-ms365**.

5. Assign the **mondoo-ms365** app the **Global Reader** role.

6. When you return to the Assignments page, select **Refresh** and verify that the mondoo-ms365 app has been assigned the Global Reader role.

### Step D: Upload the application certificate.

The app registration and your Mondoo integration must share a [PEM](https://aboutssl.org/what-is-pem-certificate-file/) (privacy-enhanced mail) certificate for secure authentication. The certificate must not be password protected.

Create a PEM certificate using the method approved by your organization's security team. You need two files:

- The file you upload to Azure must have only the certificate, not the private key.

- The file you upload to Mondoo Console (in the [Add a new Azure integration in the Mondoo Console](#add-a-new-microsoft-365-integration-in-the-mondoo-console) section below) must have both the private key and the certificate. It must have a `.pem` extension and must use this format and order of information:

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
key goes here
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
certificate goes here
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

<details>
<summary>Generate a self-signed certificate for testing</summary>

For testing purposes only, you can use OpenSSL toolkit together with req to generate a certificate. Run this command in Linux shell, macOS shell, or Azure Cloud shell (bash):

```shell
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096  -x509  -sha512  -days 365 -nodes -out certificate.pem -keyout privatekey.key
```

Add the private key to the beginning of the PEM file:

```shell
cat privatekey.key certificate.pem > certificate.combo.pem
```

</details>

Upload the certificate to Azure:

1. From the Azure portal home, select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

2. In the navigation sidebar, select **App registrations**.

3. Select the app you created.

4. In the sidebar under the app name, select **Certificate & secrets**.

5. Select **Certificates** and then select **Upload certificate**.

6. Select the PEM certificate and enter a description, such as `Mondoo certificate`.

:::info

Be sure to choose the file containing only the certificate, not the private key.

:::

7. Select the **Add** button.

## Add a new Microsoft 365 integration in the Mondoo Console

After you've created and granted permissions to a new app registration, you can create a Mondoo Microsoft 365 integration. You need some values from the app registration you created in the instructions above.

1. Access the Integrations > Add > Microsoft 365 page in one of two ways:

   - New space setup: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **Microsoft 365**.

     ![Welcome to Mondoo Page](/img/platform/start/welcome_to_mondoo.png)

   - INTEGRATIONS page: In the side navigation bar, under **INTEGRATIONS**, select **Add New Integration**. Under Cloud Security, select **Microsoft 365**.

     ![integration-create-image](/img/platform/infra/saas/ms365/add-int-ms365-top.png)

2. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that lets you easily recognize the Microsoft 365 tenant.

3. In the **Enter Application (client) ID** box, enter the value from the app registration's **Application (client) ID** box.

4. In the **Enter the Directory (tenant) ID** box, enter the value from the app registration's **Directory (tenant) ID** box.

5. Specify the subscriptions for Mondoo to continuously scan.

   - To continuously scan all subscriptions in the tenant, leave the **Scan all subscriptions connected to the Directory (tenant) ID** toggle enabled.

   - To choose the subscriptions to scan, disable the **Scan all subscriptions connected to the Directory (tenant) ID** toggle, select Allowlist, and enter the subscription ID to scan.

   - To scan **all** subscriptions except those you specify, disable the **Scan all subscriptions connected to the Directory (tenant) ID** toggle, select Denylist, and enter the names of the subscriptions you don't want Mondoo to scan.

6. Provide a certificate (a [PEM](https://aboutssl.org/what-is-pem-certificate-file/) (privacy-enhanced mail) file) for Mondoo to securely authenticate with the app (service principal) you created.

The certificate file must have the `.pem` extension and must contain both the private key and the certificate in this order:

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
key goes here
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
certificate goes here
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Upload the certificate to Mondoo: In the **Drag and drop your .pem file here** box, select the cloud icon and choose the file to upload.

![integration-create-image](/img/platform/infra/saas/ms365/add-int-ms365-bottom.png)

7. To complete the integration, select the **START SCANNING** button.

8. On the Recommended Policies page, enable the policies on which you want to base assessments of your ms365 environment. To learn more, read [Manage Policies](/platform/security/posture/policies/).

Mondoo begins scanning your Microsoft 365 resources. When it completes, you can see results on the INVENTORY page. To learn more, read [Monitor Your Infrastructure Security](/platform/security/posture/monitor/).
