Integrate your Azure subscription or management group with Mondoo to continuously evaluate the resources in the subscription, such as compute instances, storage, and network services.

## Continuously scan an Azure subscription

There are two options for setting up an Azure subscription integration:

- **Quick setup:** This command-line approach to integrating a subscription with Mondoo has helpful shortcuts. We recommend it for typical, small-to-large Azure environments.

- **Manual setup:** Follow this approach if you want to use your own certificates for authentication, if you use the [_key vault access policy_ permission model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-access-policy), or if your Azure environment is unusually large.

## Continuously scan an Azure management group

You can integrate an entire management group with Mondoo. This lets you continuously scan all the Azure subscriptions within the management group.
