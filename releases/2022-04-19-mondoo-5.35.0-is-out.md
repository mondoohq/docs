ü•≥ Mondoo 5.35.0 is out. This release's big features: Search assets by tags, new UI elements, and new Windows resources.

## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### **Search assets by tag and annotation key/value**

The search box in the fleet view now filters assets by tags and annotations. This simple feature adds a lot of power! For example, you can now search across multiple AWS accounts for assets with the same tag. But as cool as that is, we'll do you one better: You can also search across multiple _cloud providers._ Or GitHub accounts. Or... you get the idea.

### **New graphs on the web console**

The Mondoo Web Console has two new sets of graphs to help you see the state of your assets at a glance! First, the new radial graphs now show the breakdown of your assets by score. Mouse hovers provide more detailed information from the dashboard.

If you select the fleet view, you'll see a new bar graph showing the same distribution of assets by letter grade.

And of course, it all looks great!

### **Add annotations to assets via the config**

To create specific annotations for all assets when scanning via the mondoo agent, set the following config string:

```yaml
---
annotations:
  mdm: annotation
```

### **New Windows Resources**

Mondoo now includes new resources for better examining the security of Windows systems out of the box:

- [Windows BitLocker Volume](/mql/resources/os-pack/windows.bitlocker.volume/)
- [Windows Security Health](/mql/resources/os-pack/windows.security.health/)
- [Windows Security Product](/mql/resources/os-pack/windows.security.product/)

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Additional CI System Data

Mondoo now gathers more CI environment labels on GitLab, GitHub Actions, and Travis-CI.

### Mondoo Kubernetes Operator Improvements

The Mondoo Kubernetes operator now scans Kubernetes Deployments in addition to Pods. See the full [Operator release notes](https://github.com/mondoohq/mondoo-operator/releases/tag/v0.2.4) on the [GitHub project](https://github.com/mondoohq/mondoo-operator).
