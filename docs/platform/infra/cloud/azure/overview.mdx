Trust Mondoo to secure your Microsoft Azure environment. Mondoo identifies vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in compute instances, databases, networks, and more.

Mondoo offers a variety of approaches to evaluating your Azure infrastructure security. You can continuously scan your Azure subscriptions, evaluate builds before they go to production, and run ad hoc scans.

## Continuously scan Azure

Continuously evaluate the security of your Azure resources, such as compute instances, so that you always have an up-to-date view of your environment's security posture.

With the API-driven Mondoo Azure integration, you deploy the integration once and always get the latest security assessments for new accounts and resources:

## Scan during build time

- [Assess Risk in the Azure Container Registry](/cnspec/supplychain/registry/azure_acr.md)

- [Build VM Images with Packer](/cnspec/supplychain/packer.md)

## Scan during run time

- [Scan an Azure subscription from your workstation using cnspec](/cnspec/cloud/azure/)

- [Install cnspec via cloud-init](/platform/infra/opsys/automation/cloudinit.md)

- [Terraform deployment](/cnspec/supplychain/terraform.md)

- [Verify instances managed by Chef/AWS OpsWorks](/platform/infra/opsys/automation/chef.md)
