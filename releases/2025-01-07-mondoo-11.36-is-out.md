## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Zero in on exactly the assets you need with workspaces

Do you find yourself repeatedly searching for the same groups of assets? Do you wish you could see a subgroup of assets in your space to compare them or measure progress on a certain project? Are some assets just getting in the way of what you want to focus on right now? What you need are workspaces!

Workspaces are dynamic groups of assets that you want to view and assess together. They're not part of the fixed Mondoo organizational structure like spaces are; they're flexible asset collections you assemble ad hoc to make your work easier.

Create a workspace that shows only the high-risk Windows devices in a space, another workspace that has all your infrastructure as code, and another that includes infrastructure as code with `test` in the asset name... whatever meets your specific business needs.

### Quick access to reports

Quickly access compliance reports from the Reporting page in the navigation menu. Looking for more reports? Stay tuned for more updates in upcoming releases and if you're looking for something in particular let us know at [product@mondoo.com](mailto:product@mondoo.com)!

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Optionally follow HTTP -> HTTPS redirects

You now have additional control over how HTTP hosts are scanned in the `host` provider. By default cnquery/cnspec will no longer follow redirects from HTTP to HTTPS endpoints so you can inspect your HTTP configurations when specified. If you'd prefer to follow any redirects use the new `--follow-redirects` flag:

### Improved CIS Benchmarks

Sometimes the best changes are behind the scenes. This week we shipped reworked internal tooling we use to generate CIS benchmark policies. Not only will these changes allow us to bring you the latest and greatest policies more quickly in the future, they also allowed us to make a huge number of small improvements to existing policies:

- New checks that were previously marked as requiring manual user validation
- More clear and concise descriptions for each policy
- Expanded check descriptions including rational behind the security concerns
- New audit and remediation steps in many Linux distribution policies
- Simplified MQL queries to improve readability
- Additional platform version tags to improve searching for policies
- Improve policy search results when searching for platform versions

### Quickly find integrations

Find the right integration with less scrolling. The add integration page now supports search based on integration categories in addition to integration names.
