The Mondoo S3-compatible service integration lets you continuously export your space data, such as assets, vulnerabilities, and scan results to an S3-compatible object store such as MinIO or Ceph. The export runs approximately every 24 hours.

## Requirements

To export data to your S3-compatible object store, you must have:

- Your S3-compatible object storage service up and running.

- The endpoint URL of your S3-compatible object storage service. To learn how to find this URL, read your object storage system documentation or consult your vendor.

- An _access key ID_ and _secret access key_ pair for programmatic access to the S3-compatible object storage service. To learn how to generate an access key pair, read your object storage service documentation or consult your vendor.

- Editor or Owner access to the space from which you want to export data.

## Add a new S3-compatible service integration

1. Access the Integrations > Add > S3 Compatible Service page in one of two ways:

   - New space setup: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **S3 Compatible Service**.

     ![Welcome to Mondoo Page](/img/platform/start/welcome_to_mondoo.png)

   - INTEGRATIONS page: Navigate to **INTEGRATIONS**. Under Exports, select **S3 Compatible Service**.

     ![Add an export integration](/img/platform/maintain/export/add-integration-exports.png)

2. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that lets you easily recognize the your S3-compatible service bucket.

3. In the **S3 compatible endpoint URL** box, enter the URL of your S3-compatible service.

4. In the **Bucket name** box, enter the name of the S3-compatible storage bucket to which you want to export Mondoo data.

5. Under **Export as**, select the file format in which to export Mondoo data:

   - To export as JSON Lines, select **.jsonl**.

   - To export as comma-separated values, select **.csv**.

6. To use the legacy list objects API for the export, select **Use the legacy list objects API**. To learn whether you need this, consult your S3-compatible service vendor.

7. To use path-style bucket addressing instead of virtual hosted addressing, select **Use path style**. To learn whether you need this, consult your S3-compatible service vendor.

8. In the **Access Key ID** box, enter the ID portion of the access key pair you generated for programmatic access to the bucket.

9. In the **Secret Access Key** box, enter the secret portion of the access key pair you generated for programmatic access to the bucket.

10. To complete the integration, select the **CREATE EXPORT** button.

    Mondoo begins exporting information from your space. When this initial export completes, the integration status becomes **ACTIVE**. Mondoo performs an export approximately every 24 hours.

## View an S3-compatible service integration

1. In the side navigation bar, under Integrations, select **S3 Compatible Service**.

2. In the list of your S3-compatible service integrations, select the integration you want to view.

### Statuses

The possible statuses for a your S3-compatible service integration are:

- **ACTIVE**: The integration is active/healthy.
- **PENDING**: Mondoo has not yet attempted to connect to your S3-compatible service.
- **ERROR**: Mondoo detected an error during export.

### Export data to your S3-compatible service at any time

Mondoo exports your data to your S3-compatible service approximately every 24 hours. You can also manually export data at any time. Use the **SCHEDULE NOW** button to request an export right away. Mondoo begins the export as soon as possible. If Mondoo is processing a lot of data, there can be some delay until Mondoo has sufficient resources.

### Remove an integration

To remove an integration, select the trash can icon. A confirmation prompt displays. Once you confirm the deletion, Mondoo removes the configured integration and stops triggering exports to the your S3-compatible service.

:::info

Mondoo does not delete existing exported data. You must delete the data manually.
