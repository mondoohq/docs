With these integrations, you can take advantage of Mondoo's security visualization, prioritization, and ticketing capabilities. Consolidating the data in Mondoo Platform lets you understand your biggest risks and make the most impactful changes.

Mondoo includes SentinelOne and CrowdStrike data alongside findings from Mondoo's own scans, and deduplicates so you don't have to.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Goodbye cases, hello tickets

We love customer feedback and are grateful when we can make changes driven by our users. When we learned that the name of _cases_, our task tracking capability, wasn't clear to everyone, we acted. Cases are now Mondoo _tickets_.

Ticketing still has all the same capabilities that have made this feature a game-changer for so many of our customers: seamless integration with your external issue tracking platform, remediation details in the ticket, and a user experience that saves you countless hours of work. All we changed is what we call them!
