### ðŸŽ‰ NEW FEATURES

**Space Vulnerability Views**

Mondoo has always supported inspecting an asset to track which CVEs and advisories apply. Starting today, it's now simple to also follow CVEs and advisories to understand which assets they impact.

To use the new view, open the Policy Hub and then view the Platform Vulnerability policy. The new Advisories and Vulnerabilities tabs will list all vulnerabilities and advisories applicable to assets in the fleet. Sort these by CVSS criticality, date of the first detection, or the number of assets impacted to find the highest-impact issues in your environment.

### ðŸ§¹ IMPROVEMENTS

- There is now a setting to remove terminated assets under the Space Settings tab.

Mondoo keeps an inventory of every unique asset it scans. However, some people frequently create and destroy hosts and containers, especially in cloud environments. Over time, this can lead to Mondoo tracking hundreds or even thousands of assets that no longer exist and never will again.

This new setting tells Mondoo to no longer inventory cloud-based assets destroyed by a cloud provider. The setting defaults to true for all spaces created after February 18, 2022. For spaces created prior to this date, the setting will remain false.
