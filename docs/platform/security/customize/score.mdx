When Mondoo scans the assets in your infrastructure, it calculates a letter score that represents the asset's level of security&mdash;its ability to withstand attack. A score of A indicates that the asset is well fortified against attack, while an F indicates that an asset is highly vulnerable.

Mondoo scoring is based on the [policies](/platform/security/posture/pac/) that you enable in the Mondoo space that the asset is a part of. You [choose which policies are enabled](/platform/security/posture/policies/) in a space and Mondoo assesses each asset in the space based on any applicable policies you enable. For example, to evaluate a Microsoft 365 asset, Mondoo uses any Microsoft 365 assets enabled in the space.

Letter scores are based on numeric scores between 0 and 100. These are the ranges for Mondoo letter scores:

| From... | To... | Letter score |
|:-------:|:-----:|:------------:|
| 80      | 100   | A            |
| 60      | 79    | B            |
| 30      | 59    | C            |
| 10      | 29    | D            |
| 0       | 9     | F            |

## How Mondoo calculates scores

There are four different methods Mondoo can use to calculate an asset's numeric score on a policy:
