## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Windows filesystem scanning

Need to inspect a Windows system, but don't have access to install cnquery on the system? Now you can attach the drive, or a snapshot of the drive, to another Windows system and run cnquery shell complete with access to all of Mondoo's Windows MQL resources.

Run cnquery shell against a drive by serial number:

```shell
./cnquery.exe shell device --serial-number 123455
```

Run cnquery shell against a specific LUN:

```shell
./cnquery.exe shell device --lun 2
```

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Infrastructure as code inventory group

Find Mondoo scanned Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files quickly with a new Infrastructure as Code asset group in the Mondoo Console inventory page:

### Improved risk factor display

We improved the risk assessment view on CVE and advisory pages so you can better understand which risks apply to assets and which don't.

### Expanded Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) policy support

The Mondoo Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) policy now detects systems running Windows Defender with up-to-date definition files.

### Kubernetes service discovery

Expand visibility into your Kubernetes cluster with discovery of Kubernetes services as assets in the Mondoo Console.

### Find files by permission

Use the expanded `files.find` MQL resource to find files containing specific permissions across entire filesystems or specific paths . Pass in standard UNIX octal permission values to find files containing those permissions. Note: This is not an exact match. Searching for '0001' returns all files with execute on other, even if they also have read and write on other.

```coffee
cnquery> files.find(from: "/etc", type: "file", xdev: false, permissions: 0001)
files.find.list: [
  0: file path="/etc/periodic/daily/999.local" size=712 permissions.string="-rwxr-xr-x"
  1: file path="/etc/periodic/monthly/999.local" size=606 permissions.string="-rwxr-xr-x"
  2: file path="/etc/periodic/weekly/999.local" size=620 permissions.string="-rwxr-xr-x"
  3: file path="/etc/security/audit_warn" size=1326 permissions.string="-r-xr-xr-x"
```
