With cnquery, you can explore and interrogate your entire Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, including its compute instances. It's like having a powerful search engine for your GCP environment. For example, you can analyze firewalls, search for Compute Engine instance configuration details, or find all Cloud Storage buckets that anonymous or public users can access... all with a single tool.

cnquery provides the answers you need about every GCP configuration. For a list of GCP resources you can query, read [Mondoo Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/gcp-pack/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core-pack/).

## Connect cnquery with your GCP environment

### Requirements

To explore your GCP environment with cnquery, you must have:

- [cnquery installed on your workstation](/cnquery/)
- A [Google Platform account](https://cloud.google.com/free)
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) installed

### Provide access credentials

In your terminal, log into GCP with this command:

```bash
gcloud auth login  --update-adc
```

### Configure the GCP project you want explore

To query a GCP project, you must set up the project:

```bash
gcloud config set project PROJECTID
```

For `PROJECTID`, substitute the ID of the project you want to query.

GCP confirms the setup:

```bash
Updated property [core/project].
```

To verify your configuration, enter:

```bash
gcloud config list
```

GCP returns results similar to these:

```
[core]
account = suki@lunalectric.com
disable_usage_reporting = True
project = gcp-project-id

Your active configuration is: [default]
```

### Verify with a quick GCP query

To quickly confirm that cnquery has access to your GCP environment, run this query from your terminal:

```bash
cnquery run gcp -c gcp.project
```

cnquery returns the name of the project:

```shell
→ discover related assets for 1 asset(s)
→ resolved assets resolved-assets=1
gcp.project: gcp.project name="lune-edge"
```

You've successfully used cnquery to answer your first question about your GCP environment. Now you're ready to explore.

## Query a Google Cloud project

To answer any question about your environment, use cnquery's interactive shell. It has auto-complete to guide you, which is especially helpful when you're new to cnquery and learning MQL.

To launch a shell into your GCP environment, enter:

```bash
cnquery shell gcp
```

### Discover capabilities with the `help` command

Once inside the shell, use the `help` command to learn what GCP resources you can query. This command lists all the GCP resources:

```coffee
help gcp
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down further. For example, enter this command to list all the GCP DNS resources you can query:

```coffee
help gcp.dns
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down even further. You can also learn about available GCP resources in the [Mondoo Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/gcp-pack/).

### Query Compute Engine instances

Now that you know how to discover what's possible with cnquery, let's run some actual queries in the shell.

This query lists all the Compute Engine instances in the project:

```coffee
gcp.project.computeService.instances
```

cnquery returns a list of instances:

```coffee
gcp.project.computeService.instances: [
  0: gcp.project.computeService.instance name="amos-test-instance1"
  1: gcp.project.computeService.instance name="ansible-centos"
  2: gcp.project.computeService.instance name="centos7-latest"
  3: gcp.project.computeService.instance name="debian10"
  4: gcp.project.computeService.instance name="luna-dev"
  5: gcp.project.computeService.instance name="luna-edge"
 6: gcp.project.computeService.instance name="luna-service"

...

]
```

#### Request full details in results

For a more detailed report, you can specify that you want all fields:

```coffee
gcp.project.computeService.instances { * }
```

For every instance, cnquery provides information about their status and settings:

```coffee

      }
    ]

  }

```

#### Specify fields to include in results

If you're interested in only some details, specify the fields you want in braces. For example, this query asks for each user's ARN, when they last changed their password, and whether they have MFA enabled:

```coffee
gcp.project.computeService.instances { name status scheduling }
```

cnquery returns results like this:

```coffee
gcp.project.computeService.instances: [

...

  12: {
    status: "TERMINATED"
    scheduling: {
      automaticRestart: true
      onHostMaintenance: "MIGRATE"
      provisioningModel: "STANDARD"
    }
    name: "luna-test"
  }
  13: {
    status: "RUNNING"
    scheduling: {
      automaticRestart: true
      onHostMaintenance: "MIGRATE"
      provisioningModel: "STANDARD"
    }
    name: "luna-edge"
  }

...

]
```

#### Filter results

You can filter results based on any fields. Specify the criteria using the `where` function and standard boolean operators.

For example, this filters results based on status:

```coffee
gcp.project.computeService.instances.where(status == "RUNNING") { name lastStartTimestamp }
```

cnquery returns all running instances. It includes the name and last start for each one.

```coffee
gcp.project.computeService.instances.where: [
  0: {
    name: "luna-edge"
    lastStartTimestamp: 2022-11-17 02:58:31.254 -0800 PST
  }
  1: {
    name: "windows-gitlab"
    lastStartTimestamp: 2021-08-05 11:39:20.217 -0700 PDT
  }
]
```
