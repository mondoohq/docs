Mondoo continuously assesses your compliance. At any time, you can:

- View up-to-date information on whether your infrastructure complies with your chosen [frameworks](/platform/compliance/monitor/frameworks/)

- See a space's overall compliance and drill down into the details for different [controls, checks](/platform/compliance/monitor/frameworks/), and assets

- Generate a report to export or print evidence of (or progress toward) compliance

## View a space's compliance progress

Mondoo expresses overall compliance as a percentage. A space is compliant with a framework only when it reaches 100%. Lower percentages show _progress_ toward full compliance.

View a space's progress toward compliance with all available frameworks on the Compliance page:

1.  In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the space where you want to enable the policies.

2.  In the side navigation bar, under **Compliance**, select **Frameworks**.

    ![Compliance in the Mondoo Console](/img/platform/compliance/home.png)

    The Compliance page shows all available frameworks and the space's progress toward compliance with each of them.

## View evidence of compliance

From the Compliance Frameworks page, you can select a framework to learn more about the space's compliance with that framework.

**COMPLETION** shows overall progress toward compliance.

Using the tabs in the lower portion of the framework page, you can drill down into different details.

- The **Controls** tab lists all the controls in the framework. You can see your progress on each control and select a control to see details on the checks it maps to.

- The **Policies** tab lists all the policies that contain the checks this framework maps to. You can enable, snooze, and disable policies.

- The **Assets** tab shows the compliance progress of all the assets in the space. You can select an asset to view its details.

- The **Exceptions** tab shows any customization you've created for the framework. To learn more, read [Customize Compliance](/platform/compliance/customize/overview/).

## Generate a compliance report

To provide evidence to auditors, you can generate a report on a space's compliance with an entire framework or an individual control. Mondoo creates reports in PDF format.

   If you want to create a report on a single control, select the control in the **Controls** table.

4. To the right of the framework or control title, select the **Generate Report** (download symbol) icon.

6. Select the **VIEW REPORTS** button to go to the Compliance Reports page. It can take some time for Mondoo to generate a PDF with all the requested compliance data. If the new report is still in progress, you can leave and return to the Compliance Reports page later to retrieve it.
