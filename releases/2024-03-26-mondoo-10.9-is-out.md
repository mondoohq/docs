Let Mondoo do the heavy lifting when it comes to remediating critical software vulnerabilities in your infrastructure with new Ansible and Bash remediation scripts to accelerate the patching of systems.

### Expose remote exploits in your infrastructure

With the new "Remote execution" risk for CVEs and advisories, you can now prioritize and patch the highest risks to your business before attackers find them. Mondoo lets you sort by CVEs and vendor advisories that are known to be susceptible to remote code execution over the network.

Learn more in our all [new Ansible docs](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/infra/opsys/automation/ansible/)!

### Signed providers on Windows

Is it an advanced security product or a virus? It turns out that sometimes your endpoint protection software can't tell the difference. To help, we're signing all Mondoo providers to prevent tools flagging providers as potentially malicious software.

### Friendly messages for space viewers in Kubernetes integrations

Want to take a peak at the configuration of Kubernetes integrations, but you only have the viewer permissions on the space? No worries. Kubernetes integration pages now show friendly messages when service account information is unavailable due to a lack of permissions. Stay curious.
