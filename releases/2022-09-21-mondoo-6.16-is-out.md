## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Scan Kubernetes Resources on Add/Update

**Problem:** You rapidly deploy new and updated workloads to your Kubernetes cluster and you want to know that the Mondoo scan results reflect the latest state of your cluster.

**Solution:** Mondoo now scans your Kubernetes resources as they are updated or added to the cluster, so the fleet view always has the latest information on cluster-wide security.

Note: This requires the Mondoo Operator for Kubernetes 1.5 or later. To update to this new release run:

```bash
kubectl delete --ignore-not-found -n mondoo-operator deployment mondoo-operator-controller-manager
kubectl apply -f https://install.mondoo.com/k8s/operator
```

### Mondoo Policy for Google Cloud Terraform Plans

**Problem:** You want to find Google Cloud security issues early in your infrastructure development cycle to prevent insecure changes from ever reaching production.

**Solution:** This week, we're introducing a new policy, Terraform Plan - CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark. It lets you run Mondoo security scans directly against HashiCorp Terraform plans for your Google Cloud infrastructure.

### Top Five Recommended Actions

**Problem:** Mondoo found a lot of security issues for your asset and you're overwhelmed. It's hard to know what to fix first.

**Solution:** The asset view now shows the five most important actions you should take to improve an asset's security.

### View All Controls for an Asset

**Problem:** You want to find a specific control that is applied to an asset, but you don't know which policy it's in.

**Solution:** Mondoo now lists all of an asset's controls independently from their policies. You can filter controls by policy or by search string.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### New Security and Best Practices Controls for Kubernetes

**Problem:** You want to scan your workloads for common security and best practice misconfigurations before deploying them to your Kubernetes cluster.

**Solution:** We've expanded our Kubernetes Security Benchmark and Kubernetes Best Practices Benchmark to expose more common misconfigurations in Kubernetes workloads.

- **Workloads should not run in the default namespace**&mdash;This new Kubernetes Best Practices Benchmark control discovers workloads that haven't defined a non-default namespace in which to run. It's best to group workloads into non-default namespaces to better organize work by teams and to isolate workloads.

- **Workloads should not run with SYS_ADMIN capability**&mdash;This new Kubernetes Security Benchmark policy discovers workloads with the SYS_ADMIN or ALL capabilities. The SYS_ADMIN capability is risky because it provides a pod with root capabilities.

- **Workloads should not run with NET_RAW capability**&mdash;This new Kubernetes Security Benchmark policy discovers workloads with the NET_RAW or ALL capabilities. Attackers can use the NET_RAW capability to craft fake packets on the host, which they can use to redirect network traffic bound for other pods.

- **Pods should have an owner**&mdash;This new Kubernetes Best Practices Benchmark control discovers pods that do not have an owner. These pods, commonly called _naked pods,_ don't respawn if the node they're running on fails or terminates.

### BIOS Updates Control Added to Client Linux Security Baseline by Mondoo

**Problem:** To secure the boot process, you need to ensure that all Linux systems have the most up-to-date BIOS releases.

**Solution:** The Client Linux Security Baseline by Mondoo now includes a control to validate that systems have the most up-to-date BIOS when the `fwupd` utility is installed.

### Error Messages for Unavailable Assets

**Problem:** You need to know when Mondoo can't connect to an asset.
**Solution:** Mondoo now shows an error message on the asset page when it fails to reach the asset.

## 🐛 BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Renames potentially confusing control titles in Linux Security Baseline by Mondoo policy.
- Skips internal fields in the `mondoo shell` help output.
- Improves error handling in the AWS Lambda scans.
- Changes Mondoo agent searches to not be case sensitive.
- Returns more helpful error messages from Mondoo Client when a necessary environment variable is missing on CI platforms.
- Fixes missing available packages in asset Platform Vulnerabilities pages.
- Improves the handling of null data for regular data types: We now consistently return non-null data from the upstream service. In the next major release, we will support storing other null data.
- Fixes failures parsing Linux kernel parameters when files in `/proc/sys` can't be read.
- Networks and domains are now properly grouped in the fleet view.
