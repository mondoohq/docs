Once you've ensured that [cnspec can access your AWS environment](/cnspec/cloud/aws), you can begin testing. The method you choose depends on your goals:

- For widescale assessment of your AWS infrastructure, scan using policy bundles. These collections of tests work together to present a broad picture of your AWS security posture.
- To run ad hoc checks against your AWS environment, use cnspec's interactive shell. It has auto-complete to guide you, which is especially helpful when you're new to cnspec and learning MQL.

## Assess AWS security with policy-based scanning

The AWS Security by Mondoo policy is available to all in Mondoo's [cnspec-policies GitHub repo](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec-policies/tree/main/core). This collection of tests evaluates how well your environment follows fundamental AWS security best practices. It checks for misconfigurations across your entire AWS infrastructure.

To scan using the AWS Security by Mondoo policy, run:

```bash
cnspec scan aws
```

cnspec finds the default policy for AWS and runs a scan based on that policy. It returns a report summarizing the scan results:

:::tip

To examine scan results in detail, run:

```bash
cnspec scan aws -o full
```

You can also create your own policies to meet your specific needs. To learn more about policies, read [Policies](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/).

### Scan using an assumed role

To assess AWS resources that you don't normally have access to, you can use an [assumed role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html):

```bash
cnspec scan aws --role ROLE-ARN
```

For `ROLE-ARN`, substitute the role's Amazon resource name (ARN).

## Test AWS with the cnspec shell

The cnspec shell is handy for quick checks and tests, or for developing your MQL skills. Its auto-complete and help features guide you in writing checks.

To launch a shell into your AWS environment, enter:

```bash
cnspec shell aws
```

### Discover capabilities with the `help` command

Once inside the shell, use the `help` command to learn what AWS resources you can test. This command lists all the AWS resources:

```bash
help aws
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down further. For example, enter this command to list all the AWS IAM resources you can test:

```bash
help aws.iam
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down even further. You can also learn about available AWS resources in the [Mondoo Amazon Web Services (AWS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/aws-pack/).

### Run tests in the cnspec shell

Now that you know how to discover what's possible with cnspec, let's run some actual tests in the shell.

#### Assess CloudTrail encryption

This test assures that every CloudTrail has a KMS key:

```bash
aws.cloudtrail.trails.all(kmsKey != null)
```

If the test passes (all CloudTrails have KMS keys) then cnspec returns `ok`:

```coffeescript
[ok] value: true
```

If the test fails, (one or more CloudTrails do not have KMS keys) then cnspec provides details about the failure:

```coffeescript
[failed] [].all()
  actual:   [
    0: aws.cloudtrail.trail id = arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:921877552404:trail/s3-events
  ]
```

The sample results above show that the account's single CloudTrail is not using encryption.

#### Assess IAM

When we explored the help for `aws.iam`, we saw that cnspec can run checks against your account's IAM credential report. For example, this test asserts that all users have MFA enabled:

```bash
aws.iam.credentialReport.all ( mfaActive == true )
```

If one or more users aren't using MFA, cnspec lists them:

```coffeescript
[failed] [].all()
  actual:   [
    0: aws.iam.usercredentialreportentry id = aws/iam/credentialreport/arn:aws:iam::921000052404:user/abel
    1: aws.iam.usercredentialreportentry id = aws/iam/credentialreport/arn:aws:iam::921000052404:user/coco
    2: aws.iam.usercredentialreportentry id = aws/iam/credentialreport/arn:aws:iam::921000052404:user/ecs-deploy
    3: aws.iam.usercredentialreportentry id = aws/iam/credentialreport/arn:aws:iam::921000052404:user/gitlab-migration-user
  ]
```

#### Specify fields to include in results

If you're interested in only some details, specify the fields you want in braces. For example, this is the same test as above, but also asks for each user's ARN, when they last changed their password, and whether they have MFA enabled:

```bash
aws.iam.credentialReport { mfaActive == true arn passwordLastChanged mfaActive }
```

### Exit the cnspec shell

To exit the cnspec shell, either press `Ctrl + D` or type `exit`.
