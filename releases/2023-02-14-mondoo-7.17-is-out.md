## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Continuous Amazon ECR and ECS scanning

**Problem:** You want to continuously scan Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) registries and Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) containers using the Mondoo AWS integration.

**Solution:** You can now configure the Mondoo AWS integration to continuously scan your ECR and ECS infrastructure, providing security insight to your critical container infrastructure.

### New azure.subscription.aks.cluster resource

**Problem:** You want to write policies to secure your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

**Solution:** A new `azure.subscription.aks.cluster` resource allows you to explore and secure the settings in your Kubernetes control plane.

To list all AKS clusters:

```coffeescript
cnquery> azure.subscription.aks.clusters
azure.subscription.aks.clusters: [
  0: azure.subscription.aksService.cluster name="aks-dev-cluster" location="westeurope"
]
```

To select particular fields for each cluster:

```coffeescript
cnquery> azure.subscription.aks.clusters{name rbacEnabled kubernetesVersion powerState}
azure.subscription.aks.clusters: [
  0: {
    rbacEnabled: true
    powerState: "Running"
    kubernetesVersion: "1.24.9"
    name: "aks-dev-cluster"
  }
]
```

### Detect and secure PLCnext programmable logic controllers

**Problem:** You need to secure Phoenix PLCnext programmable logic controllers to protect your physical infrastructure.

**Solution:** cnspec and cnquery now detect Phoenix PLCnext PLCs, and we've introduced a new community [Phoenix PLCnext Security Policy](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec-policies/blob/main/community/mondoo-phoenix-plcnext-security.mql.yaml) that includes 22 security guidelines based on recommendations from PLCnext community.

cnquery PLCnext platform output:

```coffeescript
platform: {
  name: "plcnext"
  build: "d755854b5b21ecb8dca26b0a560e6842a0c638d7"
  title: "PLCnext"
  version: "23.0.0.65"
}
```

### New `aws.ssm` resource

**Problem:** You want to write policies to secure your AWS Systems Manager (SSM) instances.

**Solution:** A new `aws.ssm` resource allows you to explore and secure the settings in your AWS Systems Manager (SSM) infrastructure.

To query SSM data using cnquery:

```coffeescript
cnquery> aws.ssm.instances { * }
aws.ssm.instances: [
  0: {
    arn: "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:185972261234:instance/i-0f58c727dc7ca1337"
    platformName: "Microsoft Windows Server 2022 Datacenter"
    ipAddress: "172.1.89.50"
    instanceId: "i-0f58c727dc7ca1337"
    region: "us-west-2"
    pingStatus: "Online"
    tags: {
      Name: "test-win"
    }
  }
  1: {
    arn: "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:185972261234:instance/i-04680e19801302600"
    platformName: "Amazon Linux"
    ipAddress: "172.1.80.30"
    instanceId: "i-04680e19801302600"
    region: "us-west-2"
    pingStatus: "Online"
    tags: {
      Name: "badssm"
    }
  }
...
```

Or write a query for a policy:

```coffeescript
cnquery> aws.ssm.instances.all(pingStatus == "Online")
[ok] value: true
```

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Better integrations navigation menu

We received tons of great feedback on the new navigation menu we released last week with Mondoo 7.16. Many of you asked for a simpler integrations menu that better represented the integrations in your spaces. This week we reworked the integrations menu to only show the integrations you've already set up and to always include a link to add new integrations. Thank you, everyone, for all the great feedback.

![Integrations](/img/releases/2023-02-14-mondoo-7.17-is-out/integrations.png)

### Input validation when setting up Azure and Microsoft 365 integrations

Securing your cloud can be difficult, but Mondoo shouldn't be. We've added example text and input validation to the Azure and Microsoft 365 integration setup pages to ensure you set up integrations with the correct values.

![Integration Validation](/img/releases/2023-02-14-mondoo-7.17-is-out/validation.png)

### Immediately scan GCP, Azure, and Microsoft 365 after setup

Our GCP, Azure, and Microsoft 365 integrations now start scanning your infrastructure after setup so you can see results in minutes.

### Improved platform names and grouping for cloud & SaaS assets

To make it easier to find your assets, we've renamed several platforms and added new groups in the fleet view. `azure`, `slack`, and `okta` assets are now `azure-subscription`, `slack-team`, and `okta-org` to better represent what they contain. The fleet view includes new Okta, Google Workspace, and Slack groups for filtering assets by SaaS service.

![Fleet](/img/releases/2023-02-14-mondoo-7.17-is-out/fleet.png)

### Show asset advisory counts in CVE views

CVE pages now show information on the asset score for each affected asset as well as the total number of advisories for each asset so you can better prioritize which assets to patch first.

![CVE View](/img/releases/2023-02-14-mondoo-7.17-is-out/cve.png)

### Deploy cnspec with Chef Infra

The [mondoo cookbook 0.5.0](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/mondoo/versions/0.5.0) is now available on [Chef Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/). This updated release now configures systems to use the cnspec service. If your system was configured with the existing cookbook release, don't worry; this release will automatically update systems from the `mondoo` service to the `cnspec` service.

### Improve Google Workspace command

`googleworkspace` is a tricky one to read so we renamed the Google Workspace provider to `google-workspace`. Now you can scan Google Workspace with the `cnspec scan google-workspace` command. Don't worry though; the old command still works to maintain backwards compatibility for automation.

### Identify scratch containers

cnspec now detects the platform and architecture of containers built from scratch. Many projects, including Kubernetes, use scratch-built containers.
