## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### CIS benchmarks for GitLab security

Secure your critical supply chain infrastructure with our new CIS GitLab benchmark policies. These policies include 27 checks for users, groups, and projects in level 1 and level 2 policies. Each policy is compatible with both self-hosted and SaaS GitLab instances.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Focus Kubernetes scanning on top-level resources

Focus on the workloads that matter to your business with the latest release of the Mondoo Kubernetes Operator. Mondoo now scans top-level workloads only so that:

- Results better reflect the actual state of security in your cluster.

- All results in Mondoo can be traced back to actual Kubernetes manifest code that you can update.

For example, if you define a CronJob in a Kubernetes manifest, we scan only the CronJob workload asset instead of also scanning the Job and Pod assets during each execution of the CronJob. In this case, hundreds of child assets no longer scan. Space statistics don't reflect ephemeral child assets that are no longer present in the cluster.

In addition to a more focused set of assets in the Mondoo Console, you now also experience faster scans and lower scan memory usage. We saw a 3x improvement in our test clusters!

### Linux Mint 22 CVE and EOL detection

Secure the latest release of Linux Mint with new support for CVE scanning and EOL detection in Linux Mint 22.

### Data export improvements

Mondoo data exports now include more data than ever so you can feed your critical security findings into external SIEM or data warehousing systems. Exports now include vulnerability data as well as detailed asset scoring information.
