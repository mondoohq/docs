Export your space data to a .csv file to import it into your business intelligence, analytics, and reporting tools. You can open or import the .csv file in Microsoft Excel, Tableau, Zoho Analytics, Power BI, SAP Crystal Reports, or any software that can read data in a comma-separated value format. This lets you manipulate your security and compliance data and include it in reports that exactly suit your business needs.

## Run a .csv export report

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to the space with the data you want to export.

2. In the side navigation bar, select **Reporting**.

5. If you want, customize the name of the .csv file Mondoo creates.

6. Select the **GENERATE REPORT** button.

7. Because Mondoo spaces contain a great deal of data, it can take a few minutes to create the .csv file. Mondoo shows the generating file in progress. When it's finished, you can download it: On the row for the report you want, select the download icon.

## Manage reports

Mondoo keeps all reports you generate in a space. At any time, you can return to the Reporting page and view or download a report you previously generated.

If you no longer need a particular report, you can delete it: On the row for the report you want to delete, select the trash can icon.

To delete multiple reports at once, check the boxes beside the reports you want to delete and select the **DELETE** button.
