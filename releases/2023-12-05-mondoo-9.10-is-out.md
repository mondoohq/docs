## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Compliance evidence report generation in PDF format

Prove compliance to your auditors with PDF evidence reports. Now you can export reports from any control page or export an archive containing controls for your whole compliance framework.

![Generate a report](/img/releases/2023-12-05-mondoo-9.10-is-out/generate.png)

These reports are specifically formatted for auditors and ready for attachment to GRC systems or other auditor evidence upload solutions.

We've got you covered with secure storage as well, so you can share reports between team members without insecure email attachments or unauthenticated URLs.

### Exceptions for assets and policies

The power and visibility of compliance exceptions is now available outside of compliance: You can now set exceptions for checks on assets and security policies. Asset and policy exceptions enable cross-team visibility and allow more granularity in how you prioritize your work.

Improve visibility with detailed explanations of why exceptions were created, approvals, and detailed logging. You never have to ask again who made a change and why.

Prioritize your work with time-based snoozing: Turn off a check temporarily while you work on more important issues, but don't let it fall through the cracks.

### New CIS Azure Compute Microsoft Windows Server 2019 and 2022 benchmarks

Secure your Windows Azure environment using the new Azure Compute Microsoft Windows Server 2019 and 2022 benchmarks. These benchmarks specifically target the security of Windows 2019 and 2022 Datacenter editions, using Azure's secure configuration guide settings. Each benchmark consists of domain and member server policies containing over 200 Azure-tailored checks.

### New CIS ESXi 8.0 Benchmark v1.0.0

Are you upgrading your VMware deployments to version 8.0? Mondoo has you covered with the new CIS ESXi 8.0 Benchmark version 1.0. This updated policy includes 86 checks tailored to the latest VMware release.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Updated RHEL/Oracle/Rocky/AlmaLinux 8 Benchmarks

Keep your RHEL 8 compatible servers secure with the new 3.0 release of CIS benchmarks for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Linux, AlmaLinux, and Rocky Linux. These new policies are complete reworks of the existing CIS benchmarks with hundreds of new and updated checks.

### MQL containsNone with an array of regular expressions

Now you can avoid long, chained MQL queries that check multiple regular expressions. Instead, specify an array of regular expressions:

```coffee
field.containsNone( [ /a/, /.*b/ ] )
```
