[cnspec](/cnspec/cnspec-about/) is a core component of Mondoo Platform. Think of it as both the CLI for Mondoo and part of its engine. This cross-platform binary evaluates systems and exposes misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that put your organization at risk. It's what enables Mondoo to assess and secure the IT infrastructure that powers your critical business systems.

You can invoke cnspec directly from the command line to assess the local host, perform agentless scans of remote assets, or remotely query IT infrastructure using MQL. It can also run automatically as a background service.

When combined with Mondoo Platform's management capabilities, cnspec can continuously assess your business-critical systems according to the policies you apply. Mondoo reports any deviation from those policies so that you can take immediate action.

```bash
$ cnspec scan
