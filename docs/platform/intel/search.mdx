You can quickly search an entire organization from the Mondoo Console's top navigation bar. Full-text search allows you to find a text string in every asset name, resource, and field where it occurs. It also lets you find spaces, checks, CVEs, and vendor advisories, all in the same text search.

Examples:

- Searching for the Google Cloud project ID `luna-discovery` can return not only the project asset itself but also storage buckets with that project ID and a Terraform file with the name `luna-discovery-backend`.

- You can search for `stella&#64;lunalectric.com` to see all assets in a space that contain Stella's email in any resource field.

- Search for `rds` across an entire organization to find all RDS assets in all spaces in the organization _plus_ all RDS-related checks in policies.

## Search for assets

1. In the Mondoo Console, [navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the organization or space where you want to search.

2. Locate the search box in the top-right corner of the Mondoo Console.

3. Enter search parameters in the search box and press **Enter**.

4. Use the drop-down in the top-right corner to change the scope of the search:

   - To limit your search to the current space, select **Search in Space**. (This option is available only if you're currently working in a space.)

   - To extend your search to the entire current organization, select **Search in Organization**.

5. From the results list, select the asset you want to view.

   To cancel the search, press **Esc** or select the **x** on the right side of the search box.
