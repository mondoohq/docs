## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Asset resource explorer

Use the new asset resource explorer to dive deep into the configuration of all your favorite assets in Mondoo. From the services running on Windows servers to container registries used in Kubernetes deployments, the asset resource explorer lets you navigate the critical configuration data that makes up your infrastructure.

If the data output looks familiar, that's because this new feature is powered by the same MQL resources used by cnspec and cnquery on the command line. Data is automatically gathered with new-out-of-the-box inventory query packs in the Policy Hub.

![Inventory Packs](/img/releases/2023-04-04-mondoo-8.4-is-out/query_packs.png)

Just like security policies, you can enable as many inventory packs as you'd like, and they'll run on the appropriate assets automatically. With inventory packs enabled, you'll see inventory data automatically in the new Resources tab for each asset. If you want to gather even more inventory data, you can create custom inventory packs using the hundreds of available MQL resources. See examples of inventory packs in the [cnquery-packs repository](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery-packs).

### Snowflake data exports

With Mondoo 8.2 we shipped our first data export integration: Google BigQuery. This week we everyone not running in GCP has reason to celebrate: new support for Snowflake data export.

Configure data exports just like other integrations in Mondoo, without installing anything in your infrastructure. They automatically export your Mondoo data daily.

![Snowflake Setup](/img/releases/2023-04-04-mondoo-8.4-is-out/snowflake_setup.png)

You can combine your exported Mondoo data with any other data in Snowflake and analyze it using Snowflakes's machine learning and BI features.

### Automatic Kubernetes Ingress scanning

Both cnspec and the Mondoo Kubernetes Operator now automatically scan Kubernetes Ingress resources. With the Kubernetes Best Practices policy enabled, you can also now expose expiring TLS certificates in Ingress resources.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Scan container images in .tar format

You can now use cnspec and cnquery to scan container images exported in .tar format with commands like `docker save`.

```text
docker save luna-docs -o luna-docs.tar
cnspec scan container tar luna-docs.tar
‚Üí discover related assets for 1 asset(s)

### Expanded Okta MQL resources

cnquery and cnspec now include more Okta resources so you can query and secure every aspect of your organization.

_Access billing contact of Okta organizations_

```coffeescript
cnquery> okta.organization.billingContact
okta.organization.billingContact: okta.user id="12345678910" profile[email]="chris@example.com"
```

_Access technical contact of Okta organizations_

```coffeescript
cnquery> okta.organization.technicalContact
okta.organization.technicalContact: okta.user id="12345678910" profile[email]="chris@example.com"
```

_Gather the settings of security notification emails_

```coffeescript
cnquery> okta.organization.securityNotificationEmails
okta.organization.securityNotificationEmails: {
  reportSuspiciousActivityEnabled: true
  sendEmailForFactorEnrollmentEnabled: false
  sendEmailForFactorResetEnabled: false
  sendEmailForNewDeviceEnabled: false
  sendEmailForPasswordChangedEnabled: false
}
```

_Gather Okta ThreatInsight settings_

```coffeescript
cnquery> okta.organization.threatInsightSettings { * }
okta.organization.threatInsightSettings: {
  excludeZones: [
    0: okta.network name="LegacyIpZone" type="IP"
  ]

  action: "audit"
  lastUpdated: 2023-04-02 20:29:19 +0000 UTC
}
```

_Gather Okta networks_

```coffeescript
okta.networks { * }
okta.networks: [
  0: {
    locations: []
    lastUpdated: 2022-11-01 18:30:35 +0000 UTC
