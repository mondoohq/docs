## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### New compliance framework experience

We've reworked the Compliance Hub to make it easier to start and manage audits with Mondoo. A new welcome page helps you pick you very first framework.

Choose from our ever-growing list of out-of-the-box compliance frameworks, now with helpful descriptions.

To make it easier to manage in-progress audits, we've introduced preview and active states for audits. Only frameworks in those states display in Compliance Hub, which helps you get right to what you need.

Reworked framework pages include helpful descriptions, a simpler progress indicator, and a quick selector so you can control the state of an audit.

### Sample compliance evidence with MQL

Provide sample data to auditors with a new `sample` helper in MQL. Use this helper to randomly sample a set number of items from any list or map data:

```coffee
> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].sample(3)
sample: [
  0: 2
  1: 10
  2: 9
]
```

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### CIS enterprise Linux 9 benchmarks 2.0

Bring the latest security recommendations to your enterprise Linux infrastructure with the new 2.0 release of CIS benchmarks for AlmaLinux, Oracle Linux, Rocky Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9. This major new policy update includes 630 total changes, including dozens of all-new recommendations to keep your systems secure.

### Newly certified CIS benchmark policies

Our RHEL 7, Amazon Linux 2, Oracle Linux 7, CentOS Linux 7, and GitLab CIS benchmarks have all passed the rigorous CIS benchmark validation process and received full certification for their quality and completeness. These policies add to the 130+ Mondoo CIS benchmarks already certified, making Mondoo a top vendor for CIS certified content.

### Improved Kubernetes integration setup

More easily manage workload scanning with updates to the Kubernetes integration page. These include a pre-populated namespace filter to skip scanning the operator itself and a simpler flow for enabling or disabling workload image scanning.

### Manage large numbers of Jira projects with cases

Even customers with the largest of Jira installations can use Mondoo cases. We've improved support for fetching large project lists and added a new project selection page that includes quick, text-based filtering.
