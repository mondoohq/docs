## Are you sure you want to set up Azure manually?

Mondoo offers two approaches to setting up an integration for continuous Azure scanning: automated and manual.

Follow the **manual setup** described below only in these rare cases:

- You want to integrate Mondoo with all subscriptions in a management group

- You use the [legacy access policy permission model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-access-policy) for your key vaults (instead of RBAC)

- Your Azure environment is unusually large

All other users can follow the [**automatic Azure integration setup**](/platform/infra/cloud/azure/azure-integration-scan-subscription), which takes a fraction of the time.

## Prerequisites

Before you manually integrate Microsoft Azure with Mondoo, be sure you have:

- A Mondoo account with Editor or Owner permissions for the space in which you want to add the integration.

- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) with an active subscription and permission to manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Active Directory). Any of these [Entra built-in roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) include the required permissions:

  - [Global Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator)

  - [Application administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator)

  - [Cloud application administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator)

  In the Azure portal you can see what roles your user account has: Go to **Microsoft Entra ID > Users > (your user account) > Assigned roles**.

- Command-line access to Azure using either:

  - [Azure Cloud Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart?tabs=azurecli)

  - <details>
      <summary>
        The Azure CLI in either the Linux shell or the macOS shell
      </summary>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">
              Install the Azure CLI.
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Log into the Azure CLI from PowerShell or a Linux/macOS CLI by
            entering:
            <br />
            <tt>az login</tt>
            <br />
            Azure opens your web browser and prompts you to log in. After you do
            so, you can return to the CLI.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </details>

## Register and grant permissions to an Azure app

Like any service that integrates with Azure, Mondoo must have Microsoft Entra ID app registration in your Azure tenant. To learn more about creating a new app registration and service principal, read [App registration, app objects, and service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#app-registration-app-objects-and-service-principals) in the Azure documentation.

Registering Mondoo with Entra establishes a trust relationship between Mondoo and the Microsoft identity platform. The trust is unidirectional: Mondoo trusts the Microsoft identity platform, and not the other way around. The Entra app registration creates a [service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-how-applications-are-added#what-are-service-principals-and-where-do-they-come-from) to represent Mondoo in any tenants and subscriptions.

The app registration you create gives Mondoo read-only access to Azure resources, web apps, key vault, and Graph API.

To configure your Azure resources, you must:

Step A: Register an app with Microsoft Entra ID and create a service principal

Step B: Grant permissions to access Microsoft Graph (API permissions)

Step C: Grant required READ permissions to the app

Step D: Grant web app READ permissions to the app

Step E: Grant permissions to access Azure key vault

Step F: Upload the application certificate

### Step A: Register an app with Microsoft Entra ID and create a service principal

Like any service that integrates with Azure, Mondoo must have an app registration. To learn more about creating a new app registration, read [App registration, app objects, and service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#app-registration-app-objects-and-service-principals) in the Azure documentation.

1. Log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as a global administrator, application administrator or cloud application administrator.

2. Find and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

3. In the navigation sidebar, select **App registrations**.

   ![Azure app registrations](/img/platform/infra/cloud/azure/app-regs.png)

4. Select **+ New registration**.

   ![Create a new app registration in Azure](/img/platform/infra/cloud/azure/new-app-reg.png)

5. Enter an application name (such as `mondoo-security`) and select **Accounts in this organizational directory only** as the supported account type. Mondoo does not require an application redirect URI.

6. Select the **Register** button.

   Microsoft creates the application ID and displays it in the application registration overview.

   ![new app registration in Azure](/img/platform/infra/cloud/azure/after-new-app-reg.png)

   Keep the page open as you continue to the next step.

### Step B: Grant permissions to access Microsoft Graph (API permissions)

import Graph from "./_include-graph.mdx";

<Graph />{" "}

### Step C: Grant required READ permissions to the app

These steps guide you through setting the READ permissions and "Key Vault Reader" permissions for a single subscription. If you want to scan several subscriptions, you must repeat the same steps for each subscription.

If you want Mondoo to monitor an entire management group, you can perform these steps at the management group level: Search for "management groups" in the Azure portal and then select the management group you want to monitor. To monitor the entire directory, select the **tenant root** group.

Set subscription-level permissions for your new app registration:

1. From the Azure portal home, select **Subscriptions**.

   ![Azure subscriptions](/img/platform/infra/cloud/azure/subscriptions.png)

2. Select the subscription you want to integrate with Mondoo.

   ![Azure subscription](/img/platform/infra/cloud/azure/add-int-azure-subscription.png)

3. In the sidebar under the subscription name, select **Access control (IAM)**.

4. Select the **Add role assignment** button.

5. Select the **Reader** role and then select the Members tab (or Next button).

   ![Azure Subscription Role Assignment](/img/platform/infra/cloud/azure/add-int-azure-role-member.png)

6. Select **+ Select Members**, find and select your Mondoo app registration, and select the **Select** button.

   ![Azure Subscription Role Member Assignment](/img/platform/infra/cloud/azure/add-int-azure-select-member.png)

7. Select the **Review + assign** button (or Next button), check your work, and then select the **Review + assign** button again to assign the Reader role to your Mondoo app registration.

8. Repeat steps 4-7 and this time choose the **"Key Vault Reader"** role in step 5.

   Keep the Access control (IAM) page open as you continue to Step D.

### Step D: Grant web app READ permissions to the app

import Webapp from "./_include-webapp.mdx";

<Webapp />{" "}

### Step E: Grant permissions to access Azure key vault

:::note

There are two permission models for key vaults: role-based access control (RBAC) and key vault access policy.

See what permission model your key vault uses: In the Azure portal, view the key vault's **Access configuration** settings. (You can easily change it to RBAC.)

:::

If you are using the RBAC for the key vault, there is no need for further actions; the READ permissions on the key vault will be applied by the "Key Vault Reader" subscription permissions applied in Step C.

import Keyvault from "./_include-keyvault.mdx";

<Keyvault />{" "}

### Step F: Upload the application certificate.

The app registration and your Mondoo integration must share a [PEM](https://aboutssl.org/what-is-pem-certificate-file/) (privacy-enhanced mail) certificate for secure authentication. The certificate must not be password protected.

Create a PEM certificate using the method approved by your organization's security team. You need two files:

- The file you upload to Azure must have only the certificate, not the private key.

- The file you upload to Mondoo Console (in the [Add a new Azure integration in the Mondoo Console](#add-a-new-azure-integration-in-the-mondoo-console) section below) must have both the private key and the certificate. It must have a `.pem` extension and must use this format and order of information:

  ```
  -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
  key goes here
  -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  certificate goes here
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  ```

<details>
<summary>Generate a self-signed certificate for testing</summary>

For testing purposes only, you can use OpenSSL toolkit together with req to generate a certificate. Run this command in Linux shell, macOS shell, or Azure Cloud shell (bash):

```
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096  -x509  -sha512  -days 365 -nodes -out certificate.pem -keyout privatekey.key
```

Add the private key to the beginning of the PEM file:

```
cat privatekey.key certificate.pem > certificate.combo.pem
```

</details>

Upload the certificate to Azure:

1. From the Azure portal home, select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

2. In the navigation sidebar, select **App registrations**.

3. Select the app you created.

4. In the sidebar under the app name, select **Certificate & secrets**.

5. Select **Certificates** and then select **Upload certificate**.

6. Select the PEM certificate and enter a description, such as `Mondoo certificate`.

:::info

Be sure to choose the file containing only the certificate, not the private key.

:::

7. Select the **Add** button.

## Add a new Azure integration in the Mondoo Console

After you've created, granted permissions to, and tested a new app registration, you can create a Mondoo Azure integration. You need some values from the app registration you created in the instructions above.

1. Access the Integrations > Add > Azure page in one of two ways:

   - New space setup: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **Azure**.

     ![Welcome to Mondoo Page](/img/platform/start/welcome_to_mondoo.png)

   - INTEGRATIONS page: In the side navigation bar, under **INTEGRATIONS**, select **Add New Integration**. Under Cloud Security, select **Azure**.

     ![integration-create-image](/img/platform/infra/cloud/azure/add-int-azure-top.png)

2. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that lets you easily recognize the Azure tenant.

3. In the **Enter the application (client) ID** box, enter the value from the app registration's **Application (client) ID** box.

4. In the **Enter the directory (tenant) ID** box, enter the value from the app registration's **Directory (tenant) ID** box.

5. Specify the subscriptions for Mondoo to continuously scan.

   - To continuously scan all subscriptions in the tenant, leave the **Scan all subscriptions connected to the directory (tenant) ID** toggle enabled.

   - To choose the subscriptions to scan, disable the **Scan all subscriptions connected to the directory (tenant) ID** toggle, select **Allow list** and enter the subscription ID to scan.

   - To scan **all** subscriptions except those you specify, disable the **Scan all subscriptions connected to the directory (tenant) ID** toggle, select **Deny list** and enter the names of the subscriptions you don't want Mondoo to scan.

6. To automatically discover all Linux and Windows VMs in your subscription and scan them using Azure Run Command, enable **Scan VMs**.

7. Provide a certificate (a [PEM](https://aboutssl.org/what-is-pem-certificate-file/) (privacy-enhanced mail) file) for Mondoo to securely authenticate with the app (service principal) you created.

   The certificate file must have the `.pem` extension and must contain both the private key and the certificate in this order:

   ```
   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   key goes here
   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   certificate goes here
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----
   ```

   Upload the certificate to Mondoo: In the **Drag and drop your .pem file here** box, select the cloud icon and choose the file to upload.

   ![integration-create-image](/img/platform/infra/cloud/azure/add-int-azure-bottom.png)

8. Select the **START SCANNING** button.

9. On the Recommended Policies page, enable the policies on which you want to base assessments of your Azure environment. To learn more, read [Manage Policies](/platform/security/posture/policies/).

10. Select **FINALIZE SETUP**.

Mondoo begins scanning your Azure resources. When it completes, you can see results on the INVENTORY page. To learn more, read [Monitor Your Infrastructure Security](/platform/security/posture/monitor/).

If your integration is unsuccessful, read [Troubleshoot an Azure Configuration](/platform/infra/cloud/azure/troubleshoot/).

## Renew application certificate

The application certificate created as part of adding the Azure integration has a limited lifetime (by default 1 year). When this certificate expires the integration will no longer function.
Renewing the application certificate can be done from the Azure CLI:

1. Navigate to the app registration you created for Mondoo as part of the integration. Copy the application ID for the next steps.

2. Open the Azure Cloud Shell (top right of the window). We will be renewing the certificate with a newly created one.

3. Enter the following command, inserting the application ID you copied: `az ad app credential reset --id XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXX --create-cert`

4. The certificate will be stored in your cloud shell. You can download it from there through the "Manage files" button of the Azure Cloud Shell.

5. Navigate to the Integrations > Azure > your Azure integration page in the Mondoo Console.

6. Edit the integration and scroll down to point 5. You should see the following field where you can upload the created certificate:

   ![Refresh certificate image](/img/platform/infra/cloud/azure/refresh-app-cert.png)

7. Upload your newly created certificate and save your updated configuration. The Azure integration will start using the new certificate for communication with Azure.
