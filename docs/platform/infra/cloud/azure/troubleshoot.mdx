Test your Azure configuration to ensure that the app registration and all the permissions are configured properly. You can do so using Mondoo's open source security scanning CLI, cnspec.

## Scan with cnspec

1. From your terminal, download the latest cnspec package from here: [https://releases.mondoo.com/cnspec/](https://releases.mondoo.com/cnspec/)

   Example:

   ```bash
   wget https://releases.mondoo.com/cnspec/8.9.0/cnspec_8.9.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   tar -xvf cnspec_8.9.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   ```

2. Scan your Azure platform:

```bash
./cnspec scan azure --subscription YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID --tenant-id YOUR-TENANT-ID --client-id YOUR-CLIENT-ID  --certificate-path certificate.combo.pem --policy-bundle mondoo-azure-security.mql.yaml
```

For `YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID`, `YOUR-TENANT-ID`, and `YOUR-CLIENT-ID`, substitute your Azure information. The client ID is also called the application ID or app ID.

Pay special attention to the queries showing `Error` results; they can result from improper permissions.

## Troubleshoot: Scan with cnspec using a client secret

If the scan above is unsuccessful, try using a client secret to authenticate and scan.

1. Create a client secret:

   a. From the Azure portal home, select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

   b. In the navigation sidebar, select **App registrations**.

   c. Select the app you created for Mondoo.

   d. In the sidebar under the app name, select **Certificate & secrets**.

   e. Select **New client secret**.

   f. Enter a description for the client secret.

   g. For **Duration**, specify a time after which the secret expires.

   h. Select **Add** and quickly record the `Value`; it will disappear shortly.

2. Scan with cnspec using the client secret:

   ```bash
   ./cnspec scan azure --subscription YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID --tenant-id YOUR-TENANT-ID --client-id YOUR-CLIENT-ID  --client-secret YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET-VALUE  --policy-bundle mondoo-azure-security.mql.yaml
   ```

   For `YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID`, `YOUR-TENANT-ID`, and `YOUR-CLIENT-ID`, substitute your Azure information.

   For `YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET-VALUE`, substitute the value you recorded above.

   If this scan is successful after the first scan was unsuccessful, then the issue is with your certificate. Follow the steps above again to provide a new certificate.

## Troubleshoot: Scan with cnspec using direct authentication

If you suspect that the problem is related to the app, it's helpful to scan using direct authentication. This only works if your current user account has adequate privileges.

```bash
./cnspec scan azure --subscription YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID --policy-bundle mondoo-azure-security.mql.yaml
```

For `YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID`, substitute your Azure subscription ID.

## Troubleshoot: Manually register and configure a new app

If you're unsuccessful with these troubleshooting approaches, try using the Microsoft's "manual" method for creating and configuring an app registration: read [Manually Set up an Azure Integration](/platform/infra/cloud/azure/manual-reg-path/).
