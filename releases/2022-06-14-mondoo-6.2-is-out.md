## ðŸŽ‰ NEW FEATURES

### Automatic Container Discovery for Kubernetes

**Problem:** Customers couldn't secure containers running within Kubernetes cluster.

**Solution:** Mondoo automatically discovers and scans containers in Kubernetes clusters!

Use Mondoo to not just scan Kubernetes cluster and pod configurations, but also all the containers running within your Kubernetes clusters by enabling discovery in command line scans:

```bash
mondoo scan k8s --discover=all
```

This scan will return results for the overall Kubernetes cluster and pod security, a new asset scan for each running container, and a link to the Mondoo Console.

### Amazon Linux 2022 Support

**Problem:** Customers could not be certain that Mondoo would work as expected with the Amazon Linux 2022 preview release.

**Solution:** Mondoo has been fully tested on Amazon Linux 2022 Preview, and Mondoo now supports using Mondoo Client with Amazon Linux 2022 Preview.

## Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements

About a half-dozen minor stability improvements under the hood.
