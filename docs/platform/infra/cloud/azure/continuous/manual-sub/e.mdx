This is the fifth step in the manual setup for an Azure subscription.

## Step E: Grant permissions to access Azure key vault

:::info

There are two permission models for key vaults: role-based access control (RBAC) and key vault access policy.

See what permission model your key vault uses: In the Azure portal, view the key vault's **Access configuration** settings. (You can easily change it to RBAC.)

If you are using the RBAC for the key vault, there is no need for further actions; the READ permissions on the key vault will be applied by the "Key Vault Reader" subscription permissions applied in Step C.

If you use key vault access policy, this step is required.

:::

A key vault access policy determines whether a given security principal (a user, application or user group) can perform different operations on key vault secrets, keys, and certificates.

1. From the Azure portal home, select **Key vaults**.

2. Select a key vault from the list.

3. In the sidebar under the key vault name, select **Access policies**.

4. In the toolbar, select **+ Create**.

5. Configure the permissions:

   - Under **Key permissions**, select **Get** and **List**.

   - Under **Secret permissions**, select **Get** and **List**.

   - Under **Certificate permissions**, select **Get** and **List**.

6. Select the **Next** button.

7. From the list, select the app registration you created.

8. Select the **Next** button and select the **Next** button again to skip the Application (optional) step.

9. Review the access policy and then select the **Create** button.
