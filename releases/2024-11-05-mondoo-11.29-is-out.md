## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Risk factor customization

Tailor Mondoo's security model to match the needs of your business with risk factor customizations. Choose which risk factors matter to you and tune how much impact each risk factor has on the prioritization of findings. That way, the unique needs of your infrastructure determine which systems require urgent attention.

### Expanded risk factors

Focus on the most important systems first, with new risk factors for critical databases, file sharing, and directory services. These new risk factors surface your most critical systems first, so you can focus your energy on the highest risks to your business:

- Cassandra
- Elasticsearch
- MariaDB
- MongoDB
- OpenLDAP
- OpenSearch
- Samba

### Descriptions for organizations and spaces

Communicate the intended purpose of organizations and spaces to your coworkers, or maybe just your future self, with long descriptions for organizations and spaces. Set a description in the new organization and space creation pages or edit them after the fact in the settings pages.
