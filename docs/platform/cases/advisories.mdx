Use cases to track the work of fixing advisories in your existing workflow. When a Mondoo space has the [cases feature configured](/platform/cases/overview/), any team member can create a case from an advisory. Creating a case can:

- Create a new a Jira issue

- Create a new Zendesk ticket

- Send an email message to the recipient of your choice, such as a listener for your ticket, issue tracking, or project management software

For an overview of cases, read [Track and Fix Findings with Cases and Your Ticket System](/platform/cases/overview/).

import Partial from "../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to a space that is set up to use cases.

2. In the side navigation bar, under **Vulnerabilities**, select **Advisories**.

3. Select the advisory you want to track using a case and a corresponding issue in your ticket system.

4. To the right of the advisory name, select the **CREATE CASE** button and select **Selected Assets** to jump to the bottom of the page and see all assets affected by the advisory. (You can also select **All Assets** to create a case for all assets affected by the advisory.)

5. Check the boxes beside all the assets for which you want to track this advisory. Note that this creates a single case (and therefore a single ticket in your ticket system) for all the assets you choose. (If you want to track assets separately, create a new case for each asset.)

   Select the **CREATE CASE** button.

6. In the **Integration** box, select the where you want Mondoo to add or send the case information and provide a specific destination:

   - If you select a direct Jira integration, in the **Project** box, select the name of the project where you want to create an issue.

   - If you select an email integration, in the **Recipient** box, select where to send an email message with the case details.

7. Edit the issue summary as you wish and select the **CREATE CASE** button.

  Mondoo creates a new case in the space and then creates a corresponding Jira issue or Zendesk ticket or sends email to the selected recipient.
