This quick setup for an entire Azure management group provides efficient command line instructions to efficiently integrate all the subscriptions in an Azure management group with Mondoo. We recommend this approach if you want to monitor security of all your Azure subscriptions in a single [space](/platform/start/organize/spaces/).

## Prerequisites

Before you integrate Microsoft Azure with Mondoo, be sure you have:

- A [Mondoo account](/platform/start/plat-start-acct/) with Editor or Owner permissions for the space in which you want to add the integration.

- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) with an active subscription and permission to manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Active Directory). Any of these [Entra built-in roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) include the required permissions:

  - [Global Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator)

  - [Application administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator)

  - [Cloud application administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator)

  In the Azure portal you can see what roles your user account has: Go to **Microsoft Entra ID > Users > (your user account) > Assigned roles**.

- Command-line access to Azure using either:

  - [Azure Cloud Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart?tabs=azurecli)

  - <details>
      <summary>
        The Azure CLI in either the Linux shell or the macOS shell
      </summary>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">
              Install the Azure CLI.
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Log into the Azure CLI from PowerShell or a Linux/macOS CLI by
            entering:
            <br />
            <tt>az login</tt>
            <br />
            Azure opens your web browser and prompts you to log in. After you do
            so, you can return to the CLI.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </details>

## Quick setup steps

Like every service that integrates with Azure, Mondoo must have Microsoft Entra ID app registration and service principal. To learn more about creating a new app registration and service principal, read [App registration, app objects, and service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal#app-registration-app-objects-and-service-principals){:target="_blank"} in the Entra documentation.

Registering Mondoo with Entra establishes a trust relationship between Mondoo and the Microsoft identity platform. The trust is unidirectional: Mondoo trusts the Microsoft identity platform, and not the other way around. The Entra app registration creates a [service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/how-applications-are-added#what-are-service-principals-and-where-do-they-come-from){:target="_blank"} to represent Mondoo in any tenants and subscriptions.

The app registration you create gives Mondoo read-only access to Azure resources, web apps, key vaults, and Graph API.

To configure your Azure resources, you must:

- Step A, retrieve your management group ID.

- Step B, create the app registration and certificate and grant READ access.

- Step C, grant web app and key vault READ permissions to the registered app.

- Step D, grant permissions to access Microsoft Graph (API permissions).

For the final setup step, Step E, you add the integration in Mondoo.
