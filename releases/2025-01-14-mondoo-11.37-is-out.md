## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Create workspaces from labels/tags and annotations

Create the perfect workspace for exploring assets in your infrastructure with new filtering capabilities. Now you can create a workspace that includes or excludes all assets that match certain labels or tags, such as `environment:production`, or Mondoo annotations you set, such as `priority:high`.

Create a workspace of production cloud assets:

Create a workspace of assets you've annotated as high priority:

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS
