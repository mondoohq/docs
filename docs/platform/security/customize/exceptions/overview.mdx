Exceptions allow you to control how Mondoo evaluates findings and how you communicate the status of those findings to your team. You can use exceptions to:

- Prevent specific checks from running on certain assets
- Exclude findings from impacting risk scores
- Focus security or compliance efforts on selected checks
- Document false positives, business justifications, or temporary workarounds

Exceptions take effect immediately but can later be approved or rejected, enabling clear audit trails and accountability across your team.

## Types of exceptions

Mondoo includes two types of exceptions:

- **Disabled**: A disabled exception tells Mondoo to skip the evaluation of a check entirely. This means that the check won't run on the asset, and it won't impact the asset's risk score. Use this option when you want to completely ignore a check or to avoid potential performance / stability impacts in evaluating the check.
- **Risk Accepted**: A risk accepted exception tells Mondoo to continue evaluating a finding, but skip scoring the finding for a specific period of time. Use this option when you plan to address the finding later but want to prevent it from impacting your team's current priorities.

## Where exceptions are set

Exceptions can be set space-wide or on individual assets.

**Space wide**:

- Policy checks
- Vulnerabilities
- Vendor advisories
- Compliance framework controls
- Compliance framework control checks

**On individual assets**:

- Checks on an asset
- Vulnerabilities on an asset
- Vendor advisories on an asset

## Managing Exceptions

Mondoo includes a centralized exceptions page that allows you to view all exceptions created in a space. This page provides a comprehensive overview of all exceptions, including their status and details. You can also use this page to approve or reject exceptions and to discover exceptions that are expiring soon.
