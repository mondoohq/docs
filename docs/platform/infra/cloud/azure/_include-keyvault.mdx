If you use legacy access policy permission model for key vaults, this step is required.

A key vault access policy determines whether a given security principal (a user, application or user group) can perform different operations on key vault secrets, keys, and certificates.

1. From the Azure portal home, select **Key vaults**.

2. Select a key vault from the list.

3. In the sidebar under the key vault name, select **Access policies**.

   - Under **Secret permissions**, select **Get** and **List**.

   - Under **Certificate permissions**, select **Get** and **List**.

6. Select the **Next** button.

7. From the list, select the app registration you created.
