## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Scan Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

cnquery and cnspec now include support for scanning Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using your local OCI CLI configuration file. Explore your infrastructure configuration using cnquery or enforce security and compliance with custom cnspec security policies.

Connect to OCI using the cnquery shell:

```bash
$ cnquery shell oci
```

Query the tenant information:

```coffee
cnquery> oci.tenancy
oci.tenancy: oci.tenancy name="example"
```

Fetch all users:

```coffee
cnquery> oci.identity.users
oci.identity.users: [
  0: oci.identity.user name="alice@example.com"
  1: oci.identity.user name="bob@example.com"
  2: oci.identity.user name="john@example.com"
]
```

Fetch all groups:

```coffee
cnquery> oci.identity.groups
oci.identity.groups: [
  0: oci.identity.group name="All Domain Users"
  1: oci.identity.group name="Administrators"
]
```

Dive deeper with information from new [OCI resources](/mql/resources/oci-pack/):

```coffee
# list identity policies
oci.identity.policies

# list compute instances
oci.compute.instances

# list compute images
oci.compute.images

# list virtual cloud networks
oci.network.vcns

# list virtual cloud networks security lists
oci.network.securityLists

# list all buckets
oci.objectStorage.buckets
```

Stay tuned for additional OCI support, including Mondoo/CIS policies, and continuous scanning with Mondoo Platform.

### Slack / GitHub / GitLab integrations

Need continuous visibility into the security of the SaaS services you rely to do business? Now you can continuously scan GitHub repositories, GitLab groups, and Slack teams directly from the Mondoo console without installing anything into your infrastructure.

Find these new integrations under SaaS in the Mondoo console:

### Query Terraform plan configurations

Expand the security posture of your IaC code with a new `terraform.plan.configuration` resource for querying Terraform plan configurations.

```coffee
terraform.plan.configuration: {
  resources: [
    0: {
      address: "null_resource.this"
      mode: "managed"
      name: "this"
      provider_config_key: "null"
      provisioners: [
        0: {
          expressions: {
            command: {
              constant_value: "echo hello_world >> hello_world.txt"
            }
          }
          type: "local-exec"
        }
      ]
      schema_version: 0.000000
      type: "null_resource"
    }
  ]
  providerConfig: [
    0: {
      full_name: "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null"
      name: "null"
      version_constraint: "3.2.1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### New query pages showing impacted assets

New query pages make it easier to see which assets are affected by failing security checks. Security policy checks now have their own pages, with a tab of affected assets:

### Expanded CVE and EOL platform detection

Mondoo now detects the latest platform EOL and CVE data, so you can ensure your systems are in support and fully updated.

- Alpine 3.18 EOL/CVE detection
- Fedora 38 EOL/CVE detection
- VMware vSphere/ESXi 8 EOL/CVE detection
- Debian 12 CVE detection
- Ubuntu 22.10/23.04 CVE detection

### Create API token for spaces

Generate API tokens to query Mondoo in the Space settings.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Support UID / GUID for files on running Docker containers

cnspec now supports inspecting the UID/GUID of files within running containers:

_before_

```coffee
cnquery> file("/tmp").user.name
Query encountered errors:
cannot cast resource to resource type: <nil>
file.user.name: no data available
```

_now_

```coffee
cnquery> file("/tmp").user.name
file.user.name: "root"
```

### Pause integrations

Want to stop scanning in an integration temporarily without deleting it? Now you can pause integrations from the integrations settings pages.

### Improved CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark policy

The CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark policy now includes impact scores for each control and improved queries to return actionable results for all discovered findings.

### Simplified variants policies

In Mondoo version 8.0, we introduced the concept of policy variants so you can write a single security check that applies to assets in different parts of their lifecycle such as Terraform plans and the cloud assets they creates. With Mondoo 8.10, we've improved variants to remove repetitive coding from your policies. Variant queries now inherit fields from the parent query if they are no longer specified. This means you can set common fields like title, description, and properties once and have them propagate automatically to all variant queries.

See the [Mondoo variants documentation](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/variants/) for more information on using policy variants to simplify your policy as code experience.

### Expanded data in BigQuery exports

Mondoo exports to Google BigQuery now provide more robust data to BigQuery for analysis:

- Add policy mappings to see which check relates to which policy
- Add support for variants so that diff can work at the variants level
- Add export time to BigQuery tables
- Allow users to tag scans with snapshot names to make it easier for them to reference them in diff queries

### Improved asset cleanup in spaces

Done testing your Mondoo policy and integration settings, but need to remove all the temporary assets created during testing? Now you can delete all the assets in a space with a single selection while retaining custom policies and integration configurations.
