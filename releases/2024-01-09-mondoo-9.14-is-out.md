## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Scan Azure VMs / snapshots / disks

Use new Azure scanning capabilities to scan running VMs, instances, or disks without deploying or managing agents.

Scan snapshots of your VMs to perform agentless scans without impact to your running workloads:

```bash
cnspec scan azure compute snapshot <snapshot-name> --client-id <id> --tenant-id <id> --client-secret <value>
```

Scan snapshots outside your current resource group using the fully qualified Azure resource ID:

```bash
cnspec scan azure compute snapshot "/subscriptions/subId/resourceGroups/my-rg/providers/Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/test-debian-snap" --client-id <id> --tenant-id <id>--client-secret <secret>
```

Scan disks on running VMs with automatic running disk cloning:

```bash
cnspec scan azure compute disk <disk-id> --client-id <id> --tenant-id <id> --client-secret <value>
```

Not concerned about the impact to running workloads? Scan VMs directly without managing agent deploys:

```bash
cnspec azure compute instance <instance-name> --client-id <id> --tenant-id <id> --client-secret <value>
```

### New MQL helpers for policy authoring

New helpers for MQL give you the power to create robust security and compliance policies to meet your custom business needs.

#### Quickly access data in a map

Use dot notation to access data in maps:

```coffee
cnquery> {a: 1, b: 2, c:3}.a
[a]: 1
```

#### Check whether a time is within a range

See if time values fall within a range. This works with all timestamps:

```coffee
cnquery> password.lastChangedDate.inRange(time.now-90*time.day, time.now)
[ok] value: true
```

#### Check whether a number is within a range

See if an integer value is within a range:

````coffee
cnquery> 2.inRange(1,3)
[ok] value: true
```coffee

#### Check strings against a list of values

Check a string value against a list of acceptable values.

```coffee
cnquery> "PASS".in(["PASS","ALLOW","OK"])
[ok] value: true
````

#### Parse duration values

Work with duration values using a new duration helper:

```coffee
cnquery> parse.duration("3d")
parse.parse.duration: 3 days
cnquery> parse.duration("7days")
parse.parse.duration: 7 days
```

#### Check the contents of maps

Check keys, values, and combination of the two within maps:

```coffee
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}.contains( key == 'b' )
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}.all( value > 0 )
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}.one( value != 1 )
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}.none( key == /d-f/ )
```

#### Semantic version parsing

Compare versions without the need for complex integer parsing:

```coffee
cnquery> semver('1.9.0') < semver('1.10.0')
[ok] value: "1.9.0"
```

### New Email Security policy

A new Email Security policy includes 14 new checks for critical email security protocols, including:

- Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
- Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)
- Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC)

This policy really shines with our continuous domain and IP scanning integration (released in Mondoo 9.11). It's also handy on the CLI using cnspec.

### New Terraform Asset Inventory Pack

Use the new Terraform Asset Inventory Pack to inventory versions and resources within your Terraform state files, including resources on AWS, Azure, and GCP clouds.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### macOS and Windows policy data queries moved to query packs

To give you additional control over when cnspec collects configuration data on your assets, we've moved all data queries from our macOS and Windows security policies to the dedicated asset inventory query packs. For those who want security scanning only, this change speeds up cnspec scans. If you want to continue collecting this configuration data, enable the macOS and Windows asset inventory query packs in your space.

### Expanded MQL resources

#### aws.rds.dbcluster

- Fix `members` field to properly fetch cluster members
- New `port` field
- New `endpoint` field

#### terraform.state.resource

- Add `type` field to the default resource output

#### terraform.file

- Add `path` field to the default resource output

#### terraform.module
