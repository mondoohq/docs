## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Continuous domain and IP scanning

New continuous domain and IP scanning ensures the security and compliance of your external web properties.

![Domain Scan Integration](/img/releases/2023-12-12-mondoo-9.11-is-out/domain_integration.png)

Scan these endpoints using out-of-the-box SSL/TLS, DNS, and HTTP security policies to ensure your properties meet security best practices. Protect against common endpoint security mistakes such as:

- Certificates nearing their expiration date
- Insecure TLS releases or ciphers
- Missing `X-Content-Type-Options` in HTTP headers

![Domain Scan Result](/img/releases/2023-12-12-mondoo-9.11-is-out/domain_scan.png)

Domain and IP scans don't stop with just security. These scan results are automatically mapped to compliance controls such as SOC 2 type 2's CC6.7.2: Uses Encryption Technologies or Secure Communication Channels to Protect Data. This provides continuous compliance for your web properties.

### New AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) resource

Secure Amazon's Web Application Firewall (WAF) service with new Mondoo WAF resources. These resources allow you to query WAF ACLs, Rules, RuleGroups, and IP Sets.

See the [AWS Resource Pack documentation](/mql/resources/aws-pack/) for a complete list of new WAF resources.

### Load policies from AWS S3 buckets

Want to run custom policies across multiple systems without storing those policies in the Mondoo Platform's Registry? Now you can load policies in cnspec directly from AWS S3 buckets.

Specify an entire bucket and cnspec picks the correct policy:

```bash
cnspec scan -f s3://mysupernotexistingbucket1234567
```

Or specify the exact policy file in your bucket:

```bash
cnspec scan -f s3://mysupernotexistingbucket1234567/packs.mql.yaml
```

### New GitHub pull request query capabilities

New fields in the GitHub resource give you fine-grained control over queries for GitHub pull requests.

First, connect to your GitHub repository with the cnquery shell:

```bash
cnquery shell github repo mondoohq/cnspec
```

Once you're connected to the GitHub repo in cnquery, you can query pull requests in a few different ways.

Query individual pull requests by number:

```coffee
cnquery> github.mergeRequest(number: 1){ number state title }
github.mergeRequest: {
  number: 1
  title: "🧹  update command line help"
  state: "closed"
}
```

Query all closed pull requests:

```coffee
cnquery> github.repository.closedMergeRequests
github.repository.allMergeRequests: [
  0: github.mergeRequest id=1640488170 state="closed"
  1: github.mergeRequest id=1638254852 state="closed"
  2: github.mergeRequest id=1638253038 state="closed"

...

]
```

Query all closed and open pull requests:

```coffee
cnquery> github.repository.allMergeRequests
github.repository.allMergeRequests: [
  0: github.mergeRequest id=1640488170 state="closed"
  1: github.mergeRequest id=1640302075 state="open"
  2: github.mergeRequest id=1638694955 state="open"

...

]
```

### Improve bucket JSONL export

Do you export your Mondoo data through one of our storage integrations? We've made it easier for you to process these exports in systems like Splunk or ELK: We added `ExportedAt` and `asset_mrn` fields:

```json
{
  "mrn": "//assets.api.mondoo.app/spaces/vibrant-edison-123456/assets/2Z8pfFOyDBcZhGHi123456789",
  "asset_mrn": "//assets.api.mondoo.app/spaces/vibrant-edison-123456/assets/2Z8pfFOyDBcZhGHi123456789",
  "name": "https://mondoo.com",
  "platform_name": "host",
  "error": "",
  "score_updated_at": "2023-12-06T14:03:51Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-12-06T14:03:51Z",
  "labels": {
    "mondoo.com/integration-mrn": "//integration.api.mondoo.app/spaces/vibrant-edison-123456/integrations/2YzVgXUPvA09dZ1tBD123456789"
  },
  "annotations": null,
  "exported_at": "2023-12-06T15:12:57.619506985Z"
}
```

### Alpine 3.19 support

On December 7th the Alpine Linux team released Alpine Linux 3.19 with an updated Kernel and new versions of common language packages. Mondoo includes support for this latest release with EOL and CVE detection. Learn more about what's new in this updated version at [alpinelinux.org](https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.19.0-released.html).

### Ignore .terraform directory during scans

Want to scan Terraform files in a project directory, but the pesky .terraform directory is getting in your way? Now you can ignore files in the .terraform directory with the new `--ignore-dot-terraform` flag.
