## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Powered by new open source projects

We are excited to announce the open-source release for: [cnquery](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery) and [cnspec](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec). These are the core components of the Mondoo CLI and will replace it going forward.

[cnquery](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery) is an asset inventory and search engine, which features an interactive shell, MQL runner, and query pack execution. Query packs are a new way to create a bundle of queries which are automatically executed and all data collected. This is useful for the creation of asset inventories and collection of data during incidents. They are a lightweight alternative to policies (without scoring).

[cnspec](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec) is the security test project, which focuses on misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. It is built on top of cnquery and adds policies and scored controls. It is also a drop-in replacement to the Mondoo CLI today and uses the same commands to scan assets, run queries, open a shell, or work with policies.

Together with this open-source release, we are opening the ability to create custom resources and providers. In the coming weeks we will start to release more guides for developers who are interested in contributing.

Furthermore, we are solidifying [MQL](/mql/mql.write/) as and open standard for GraphQL-based infrastructure querying and assertions. Most of the engine can be found in cnquery and is highly extensible as well as embeddable.

We highly encourage you to try out [cnquery](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery) and [cnspec](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec)! Please let us know if you encounter any challenges switching from the Mondoo CLI to cnspec. We will continue to support the Mondoo CLI throughout the v7 release.

### CLI CVE scanning

**Problem:** Sometimes you only care about CVEs on a server, container, or container image, but you have to scan the system for security misconfigurations as well.

**Solution:** We've added a new `cnspec vuln` command that allows you to scan for CVEs on servers, containers, and container images without performing a full security scan. The command also offers more detailed CVE output so you can see what's best to patch first.

### FreeBSD scanning support

**Problem:** You run a diverse infrastructure including FreeBSD hosts which need to be properly secured.

**Solution:** cnquery and cnspec now include initial support for remotely scanning FreeBSD hosts. With this update, you can now list packages and services, examine file contents, and execute commands. Stay tuned for more FreeBSD updates, and if you have thoughts or would like to contribute resource support for FreeBSD, join the [Mondoo GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/mondoohq/discussions).

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Add ephemeralContainers to `k8s.pod`

The `k8s.pods` and `k8s.pod` and resources now includes information on `ephemeralContainers` attached to the pods. `ephemeralContainers` are a relatively new feature in Kubernetes. They let you attach containers to Pods for debugging. You can't remove them, and if you forget about them, they can introduce significant security risks to your environment.

Example workload with `ephemeralContainers` defined:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-11-03T16:40:54Z"
  labels:
    admission-result: pass
  name: passing-pod-yaml
  namespace: debug-ns
  resourceVersion: "75952"
  uid: 823d82d5-890e-4d6a-9da6-404648144585
spec:
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
  containers:
    ...
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  enableServiceLinks: true
  ephemeralContainers:
  - args:
    - sleep
    - "9999"
    image: busybox:1.28
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    name: ephemeral_junk
    resources: {}
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
    terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
    terminationMessagePolicy: File
  preemptionPolicy: PreemptLowerPriority
  priority: 0
  restartPolicy: Always
 ...
```

### Improve CLI warnings when no provider is specified

In cnquery, if the user specified an invalid provider, the CLI unexpectedly used the local provider instead:

```text
cnquery shell rockylinux
‚Üí no provider specified, using defaults.
  Use --help for a list of available providers. provider=local
‚Üí discover related assets for 1 asset(s)
‚Üí resolved assets resolved-assets=1
  ___ _ __   __ _ _   _  ___ _ __ _   _
 / __| '_ \ / _` | | | |/ _ \ '__| | | |
| (__| | | | (_| | |_| |  __/ |  | |_| |
 \___|_| |_|\__, |\__,_|\___|_|   \__, |
  mondoo‚Ñ¢      |_|                |___/  interactive shell
```

Now if a user accidentally forgets the provider usage information is provided:

```text
$ cnquery shell rockylinux
x provider rockylinux does not exist
Allows for the interactive exploration of MQL queries

Usage:
  cnquery shell [flags]
  cnquery shell [command]

Available Commands:
  arista      Connect to an Arista endpoint
  aws         Connect to an AWS account or instance
  azure       Connect to a Microsoft Azure account or instance
  container   Connect to a container, an image, or a registry
...
```

### Load base64 configuration directly from env vars

cnspec now loads a Base64-encoded configuration from the `MONDOO_CONFIG_BASE64` env var. This means you no longer need to load the Base64-encoded config in your CI jobs, write it out to a config file on disk and then run cnspec to scan your CI job.

Previously CI jobs had to write the config to disk:

```shell
echo $VARIABLE_WITH_BASE64_CONFIG > mondoo.json
cnspec scan k8s my_file.yml --config mondoo.json
```

Now with `MONDOO_CONFIG_BASE64` set you can just run the CLI:

```shell
cnspec scan k8s my_file.yml
```

### Add MQL ports resource for macOS and Windows

The MQL `ports` resource now supports Windows and macOS hosts in addition to Linux hosts. Using this resource you can track ports to listening addresses and executables:

```coffeescript
cnquery> ports.listening
ports.listening: [
  port port=56863 protocol="ipv4" address="*" process.executable="/usr/libexec/rapportd"
  port port=56863 protocol="ipv6" address="*" process.executable="/usr/libexec/rapportd"
  port port=7000 protocol="ipv4" address="*" process.executable="/System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/macOS/ControlCenter"
  port port=7000 protocol="ipv6" address="*" process.executable="/System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/macOS/ControlCenter"
  port port=5000 protocol="ipv4" address="*" process.executable="/System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/macOS/ControlCenter"
  port port=5000 protocol="ipv6" address="*" process.executable="/System/Library/CoreServices/ControlCenter.app/Contents/macOS/ControlCenter"
  port port=44960 protocol="ipv4" address="127.0.0.1" process.executable="/Users/chris/Library/Application"
  port port=44950 protocol="ipv4" address="127.0.0.1" process.executable="/Users/chris/Library/Application"
  port port=18412 protocol="ipv4" address="127.0.0.1" process.executable="/Users/chris/Library/Application"
  port port=7335 protocol="ipv4" address="127.0.0.1" process.executable="/Users/chris/Library/Application"
  port port=17223 protocol="ipv4" address="127.0.0.1" process.executable="/Users/chris/Library/Application"
  port port=17223 protocol="ipv6" address="[::1]" process.executable="/Users/chris/Library/Application"
]
```

### Auto discover ESXi hosts for vSphere

When scanning VMware vSphere assets, Mondoo now automatically discovers all ESXi hosts.

### New controls for macOS security policy

We've added new controls to the macOS Security policy to make sure that automatic updates are securely configured:

- Ensure automatic checking of software updates enabled
- Ensure automatic download of software updates enabled
- Ensure critical updates are installed automatically

### New NSA Kubernetes Hardening Guide Version 1.2 controls

We've added several new controls to the NSA Kubernetes Hardening Guide Version 1.2 policy to help you secure your Kubernetes cluster and workloads:

- Protect Pod service account tokens
- Minimize and verify access to cluster-admin binding via rolebindings
- Minimize and verify access to cluster-admin binding
- CVE-2021-25742 - checking nginx-ingress ConfigMaps for dangerous settings
