To make impactful changes to your security posture, you need a unified view of your entire attack surface. That way you can best prioritize fixes for the greatest overall improvement. Mondoo makes this possible by allowing you to import data from these third-party security tools:

- [CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight](/platform/infra/imports/crowdstrike/)

- [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/platform/infra/imports/defender/)

- [SentinelOne](/platform/infra/imports/sentinelone/)

- Check back for more integrations soon!
