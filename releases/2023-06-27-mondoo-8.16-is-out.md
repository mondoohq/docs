## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Scan GCP virtual machine instances

You need to scan your GCP VM instances for security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, but you can't impact running production workloads with an agent installation. Now you can scan GCP VM instances using snapshots to quickly inspect systems without impacting running resources:

```bash
cnquery shell gcp instance instance-name --project-id your-project-123 --zone us-central1-a
‚Üí no Mondoo configuration file provided. using defaults
‚Üí discover related assets for 1 asset(s)
‚Üí resolved assets resolved-assets=1
‚Üí found target volume device name=/dev/sdc1

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Quicker integration setup with default names

Naming things is hard, but with Mondoo integrations, you don't have to worry about it. Our integrations will automatically generate names for you, so you can start scanning sooner. If you change your mind later, you can always change the name when inspiration strikes.

### Set OCI credential on the CLI

In Mondoo 8.10, we introduced support for scanning Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in cnquery and cnspec. This week, we have extended that support to provide additional authentication options for your OCI account. You can now authenticate automatically using the OCI configuration on disk, or you can pass the authentication values on the CLI if your workstation is not set up to communicate with OCI.

```bash
cnquery shell oci --tenancy TENANCY_VALUE --user USER_VALUE --region REGION_VALUE --fingerprint FINGERPRINT_VALUE --key-path PATH_TO_KEY
```
