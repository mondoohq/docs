## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### New asset configuration insights

Have you ever struggled to respond to a security alert because you couldn't locate the asset in your infrastructure? Now with Mondoo, you can quickly track down assets in your environment, thanks to new asset configuration information available in the Mondoo Console. This new configuration data includes important asset metadata such as accounts and regions for cloud assets or make, model, and serial number for physical assets. Mondoo automatically collects this data so you don't have to worry about enabling additional policies or query packs.

Example cloud asset:

### CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark 2.0

Mondoo now includes the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark policy version 2.0. This updated release includes two new controls to ensure AWS CloudShell access is restricted and to ensure that instances only allow metadata access via IMDSv2. The policy also includes 22 updated controls with improved audit and remediation steps.

### CIS Amazon EKS Benchmark 1.3.0

Mondoo now includes the CIS AWS EKS Benchmark policy 1.3.0. This updated release replaces checks for the deprecated Pod Security Policy system with Pod Security Standards instead. It also includes six updated controls with improved audit and remediation steps.

### aws.rds.dbinstance Automatic Upgrade field

The `aws.rds.dbinstance` MQL resource now includes a new `autoMinorVersionUpgrade` field that identifies if automatic minor version upgrades are enabled for the RDS instance.
