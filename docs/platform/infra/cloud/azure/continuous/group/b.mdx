This is the second step in the quick setup for an Azure management group.

## Step B: Create the app, service principal, and certificate and grant READ access

A single command in the Azure CLI performs these tasks:

- Creates the application registration and service principal in Microsoft Entra ID

- Grants READ access (using RBAC) to the new application

- Creates a certificate and assigns it to the newly created app

In the Azure CLI, enter:

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name mondoo-security --role Reader --scopes /providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/YOUR-GROUP-ID --create-cert
```

For `YOUR-GROUP-ID`, substitute the management group ID value you copied in the step above. For example, this command creates a service principal and an application named `mondoo-security` that provides access to a management group with the ID `e4e2600a-2d3d-2600-aa70-b9d8c8ec2600`:

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name mondoo-security --role Reader --scopes /providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/e4e2600a-2d3d-2600-aa70-b9d8c8ec2600 --create-cert
```

When successful, the Azure CLI returns results like these:

```bash
"appId": "63c35483-c62f-2600-a097-a6e44d8dcdf6",
"displayName": "Mondoo",
"fileWithCertAndPrivateKey": "/Users/stella/tmpkqyme3rm.pem",
"password": null,
"tenant": "e4e2600a-2d3d-2600-aa70-b9d8c8ec2600"
```

Copy your results and paste them somewhere handy; you'll need them in later steps.

Copy the created PEM file (in the example above, it's named tmpkqyme3rm.pem) and save it; you'll need it in later steps.

:::tip

In the Azure portal, you can make sure that the created application has the required READ access at the subscription level: Go to **Azure portal > [your subscription] > Access control (IAM) > Roles (choose Reader and View) > Assessments**. If you see the `mondoo-security` application, you've succeeded.
