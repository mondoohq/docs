## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Simplified policy and query pack management

Say goodbye to the Registry and hello to simplified policy management and insights. A more intuitable organization puts the content you need at your fingertips:

- All the tasks you perform with policies are now accessible under Security.

- All the tasks you perform with query packs are now accessible under Inventory.

- All the tasks you perform with frameworks are now accessible under Compliance.

We listened to your feedback and made it easier to see what content is enabled and to enable or disable those policies, query packs, and frameworks. Customization is within closer reach with improved management of custom content and configuration of scoring vs. preview policies.

### Understand external expose with continuous Shodan scans

Gain visibility into your infrastructure's external exposure with continuous Shodan scanning. Our new Shodan integration allows you to automatically monitor domains, IPs, and even entire IP blocks for external risk.

Paired with our new Shodan Security policy and query pack, this scanning provides critical insights into what attackers know about your systems. Now you can prioritize essential fixes effectively.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Support non-ASCII characters in space and organization names

We got a bit wrapped up in 'Merica and tossed a few too many bald eagles on the space and organization creation pages. The eagles have been relocated and now customers across the globe can safely create spaces and organizations with all your favorite non-ASCII characters.
