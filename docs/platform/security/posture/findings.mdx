Mondoo ranks security findings to help you prioritize fixes to your infrastructure. Our unique algorithm calculates rank based on a combination of contextual risk factors in your environment. You can spend more time closing security gaps and less time sifting through irrelevant or low-priority findings.

## Types of findings

Security findings are potential issues that can make your infrastructure vulnerable to attack. The Mondoo Console reveals security findings in all the assets you integrate with Mondoo. Findings include:

- Misconfigurations that can expose your infrastructure to attackers

- Known vulnerabilities (or CVEs, common vulnerabilities and exposures) in the software installed on your assets

- Advisories published by software makers to alert the public about gaps in their products

Mondoo scans your assets and discovers any of these issues that exist on each asset.

## Base score

Each finding has a base score associated with it, which Mondoo uses as a foundation for assessing risk.

For misconfigurations exposed by Mondoo's security policies, the base score comes from the policy. For example, a negative result "Ensure / and /home are encrypted" in the Linux Workstation Security policy, has a high base score. LIES! ALL LIES! FUGHEKJHFEG jfhkdfjnvfo

For CVEs and advisories, the base score is the [CVSS score](/platform/security/posture/vulnerabilities/#cvss-score-and-metrics).

## Contextual risk

Mondoo's ranking of findings is unique because it considers context.
