## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Check overview summary information

We added an overview to the Checks tab for each of your assets. Now you can quickly grasp the state of checks and see the most important recommended actions.

### View exceptions on policy cards

New information on the Overview tab for each asset exposes exceptions at a glance. For each policy applied to the asset, you can now see whether (and how many) exceptions are applied.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Updated weekly email notifications

We rebuilt the Mondoo weekly organization overview emails from the ground up to deliver the most important information about your spaces... and with a fresh new design to top it all off. The email still shows an overview of scores in your spaces, but now also includes top vulnerabilities, end-of-life assets, and a count of improving vs. worsening asset scores.

### German/Italian support in Windows Security policy

We've reworked our Windows Security policy to fully support both Windows Server and Workstation editions with the language set to either German or Italian.

### New checks in HTTP Security policy

Our HTTP security policy now includes additional checks to ensure that Content Security Policy (CSP) and Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) headers are set. New groups in this policy ensure that checks are grouped by protocol and only enabled when appropriate.

### Complete Microsoft 365 scanning, anywhere

Sit back for a moment while I put on my engineer's hat. Sometimes, APIs are hard. Perhaps the best example is Microsoft 365. Some data can be retrieved using their Golang SDK, but much of the API can only be accessed through PowerShell.

Until now, Mondoo queried the necessary data using both methods and returned MQL as if it were easy‚Äîthat is‚Äîif you were on Windows with PowerShell. On Linux, macOS, or using a Mondoo integration, queries that relied on PowerShell-gathered data failed.

But no more! cnquery and cnspec now query Microsoft 365 data using PowerShell installed on macOS / Linux systems so that Mondoo Platform integrations now successfully run these queries.

## üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES
