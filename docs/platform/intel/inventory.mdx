Mondoo can provide a thorough and detailed inventory of your entire infrastructure. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), you can explore all the assets registered with your account and investigate configuration details.

Mondoo's inventory lets you drill down into an asset's configuration to learn details about that asset.

## Enable an inventory

To view an inventory of a space, you must first enable the inventories you want to see for the space. For example, if you want to inventory your AWS infrastructure, you must enable the AWS inventory for the space you want to see. All inventories are in _query packs_, collections of Mondoo queries.

import Partial from "../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), use the top navigation bar to choose the space you want to inventory.

2. In the left navigation menu, under **Inventory**, select **Query Packs**.

   The Query Packs page shows all the enabled query packs for the space, including all enabled inventories.

3. In the top-right corner of the page, select the plus symbol (+).

   The Enable Query Packs page shows all available query packs, including those already enabled for the space and those not enabled for the space.

4. To enable an inventory query pack, select the **ADD TO SPACE** button to the right of it.

Mondoo inventories the applicable assets registered to the space.

To disable a query pack for a space, select **ADDED** next to the query pack.

## View asset inventory details in the Inventory view
