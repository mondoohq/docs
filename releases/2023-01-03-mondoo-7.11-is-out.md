## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### MQL policy linting

**Problem:** Custom MQL policies can become large quickly, making it difficult to make sure they are properly formatted.

**Solution:** cnspec now includes a new `cnspec bundle lint` command that helps you find incorrectly formatted policies. This new command checks for the following conditions:

- MQL compile error
- UID is not valid
- Missing policy UID
- Missing policy name
- No unique policy UID
- Policy is missing checks
- Assigned query missing
- Policy version is missing
- Policy version is invalid
- Missing query UID
- Missing query title
- No unique query UID
- Unassigned query

![Run linting of policies from CLI](/img/releases/2023-01-03-mondoo-7.11-is-out/cnspec_bundle_lint.png)

But wait, there's more! This new linting works with GitHub Code Scanning through our Mondoo GitHub Action. Applying the updated action scans your repository for Mondoo policies, annotates pull requests with any problems it finds, and even opens GitHub Code Scanning issues for problems.

The action is compact and doesn't require a service account or any other additional setup:

```yaml
---
name: Lint Policies

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Lint cnspec policies and output SARIF
        uses: mondoohq/actions/cnspec-lint@main
        with:
          path: .
          output-file: "results.sarif"
      - name: Upload SARIF results file
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: results.sarif
```

This action scans each opened PR and merge, giving you annotations directly in the GitHub UI:

![GitHub Annotation](/img/releases/2023-01-03-mondoo-7.11-is-out/annotation.png)

The GitHub Action integrates with GitHub Code Scanning to open GitHub Code Scanning issues for each problem in your policy:

### New GCP resources

**Problem:** You want to explore and secure your GCP Pub/Sub and KMS services using cnquery and cnspec.

**Solution:** cnquery and cnspec now include new resources for securing GCP Pub/Sub and KMS services.

We added new resources to query GCP KMS Key Rings and their cryptographic keys:

```javascript
cnquery> gcp.project.kms.keyrings { * }
gcp.project.kms.keyrings: [
  0: {
    resourcePath: "projects/example-project/locations/global/keyRings/testring"
    created: 2022-12-19 15:17:46.974842182 +0000 UTC
    projectId: "example-project"
    cryptokeys: [
      0: gcp.project.kmsService.keyring.cryptokey name="testring-key" purpose="ENCRYPT_DECRYPT"
    ]
    name: "testring"
    location: "global"
  }
]
```

Inspect details for Crypto Keys:

```javascript
cnquery> gcp.project.kms.keyrings { name cryptokeys { * } }
gcp.project.kms.keyrings: [
  0: {
    name: "testring"
    cryptokeys: [
      0: {
        purpose: "ENCRYPT_DECRYPT"
        resourcePath: "projects/example-project/locations/global/keyRings/testring/cryptoKeys/testring-key"
        versions: [
          0: gcp.project.kmsService.keyring.cryptokey.version name="1" state="ENABLED"
        ]
        name: "testring-key"
        primary: gcp.project.kmsService.keyring.cryptokey.version name="1" state="ENABLED"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

We also added support for GCP Pubsub Subscriptions, Topics and Snapshots:

```javascript
cnquery> gcp.project.pubsub { * }
gcp.project.pubsub: {
  topics: [
    0: gcp.project.pubsubService.topic name="gke-cluster-event-queue"
  ]
  snapshots: []
  projectId: "example-project"
  subscriptions: [
    0: gcp.project.pubsubService.subscription  name="gke-cluster-event-queue-subscription"
  ]
}
```

See full documentation for all GCP resources in our [GCP Resource Pack docs](/mql/resources/gcp-pack/).

### Mondoo installation PowerShell module

**Problem:** You need to deploy trusted binaries from Mondoo to Windows hosts using Active Directory Group Policy or MDM solutions.

**Solution:** You can now install Mondoo using a new `Mondoo.Installer` signed PowerShell module that is published on the PowerShell Gallery at https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Mondoo.Installer/1.0. You can use this new signed module to deploy Mondoo CLIs to managed Windows hosts by running `Install-Mondoo`.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Mondoo.Installer
Install-Mondoo
```

Because our scripts and binaries are fully signed, the rollout of `cnquery` and `cnspec` was never easier. The module automatically validates if the latest version is already installed, or it updates to the newest version if required:

![PowerShell module installation](/img/releases/2023-01-03-mondoo-7.11-is-out/pwsh_module_install.png)

After the installation script is complete, `cnquery` and `cnspec` are available for use:

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Detect expiring certs in Kubernetes Ingresses

A new `Ingress certificates less than 15 days from expiration` query in the `Kubernetes Best Practices by Mondoo` policy detects certificates nearing their expiration data in your Kubernetes cluster. This query looks at all certificates defined in a Kubernetes Ingress resource that are stored as a Secret and fails when the expiration data is less than 15 days.

### Better asset scanning with the Mondoo AWS Lambda integration

The Mondoo AWS integration has been improved to better scan large and complex AWS environments:

- Scan regions with more than 1,000 running instances.
- Use AWS Instance Connect to scan instances if SSH scans fail.

### Add cnquery/cnspec to the integrations page

You can now set up cnquery and cnspec to communicate with Mondoo Platform directly on the Integrations page of the console.

## üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Fix some help descriptions not being displayed.
- Don't cut off the beginning of some help descriptions.
- Using two or more search filters in the console requires all filters to match instead of just one.
- Allow organization owners to delete invites.
- Improve the default output of the `kernel` resource.
- Fix `terraform.module` not discovering all modules.
- Fix invalid command examples in some console integration pages.
- Update Workstation integrations page text to better match terms used by cloud vendors.
