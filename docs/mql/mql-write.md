## Basic structure

All MQL code is in UTF-8 to support any characters. MQL is a type-safe and compiled language that can also be executed on the fly.

These are the basic tools of MQL:
[Resources and fields](#resources-and-fields)
[Blocks](#blocks)
[Lists](#lists)
[Basic functions](#basic-functions)

### Resources and fields

A _resource_ is a source of information about an asset in your infrastructure. These are examples of resources:

- A user on the asset
- The operating system running on the asset
- An AWS S3 bucket
- A Google Cloud compute instance
- A Terraform state
- A Microsoft Entra ID domain

Each resource has one or more _fields_, pieces of information you can request from the resource. These are examples of fields:

- A user can have a unique ID, a group, an SSH key, and more.
- An operating system can have a name, a path, and more.
- An AWS S3 bucket can have a version, can be public or not public, have encryption information, and more.
- A Google Cloud compute instance can have deletion protection on or off, a hostname, and more.
- A Terraform state can have output values, modules, and more.
- A Microsoft Entra ID domain can have a verified or unverified status, an authentication type, and more.

This example requests the platform of an asset. `asset` is the resource and `platform` is the field:

```coffee
asset.platform
```

The output would be `redhat`, `windows`, `k8s-pod`, or similar.

Access related resources

```coffee
sshd.config.file
=> file("/etc/sshd/sshd_config")

sshd.config.file.path
=> "/etc/sshd/sshd_config"
```

#### Child resources

Some resources have _child resources_. For example, the `aws.ec2` resource has multiple child resources, including `aws.ec2.volume`, `aws.ec2.snapshot`, and more.

### Blocks

_Blocks_ are a convenient way to group and extract information. They save you the trouble of repeating multiple requests for fields from one resource.

Instead of making individual requests like this:

```coffee
sshd.config.file
sshd.config.params
sshd.config.ciphers
```

You can combine them into a block:

```coffee
sshd.config {
  file
  params
  ciphers
}
```

The output is the same.

#### Nest blocks

You can nest blocks:

```coffee
sshd.config {
  file {
    path
    permissions
  }
}
```

#### Request all fields from a resource

A quick way to request all fields from a resource is by using `{*}`. For example, this requests all fields from the `services` resource:

```coffee
services { * }
```

This expands all _immediate_ fields of the given resource. It does not cascade to list any child resources.

### Lists

Some resources provide information in _lists_. For example, this requests a list of users, a list of packages, and a list of services:

```coffee
users
packages
services
```

Using blocks, you can access specific field values from every item in a list. For example, this requests the `name`, `uid`, and `home` field values for each result in a list of users:

```coffee
users {
  name
  uid
  home
}
```

### Basic functions

These help to take action on resources and fields. Some of the most important functions exist on lists and include `where`, `all`, `none`, and more.

```coffee
users.where( uid >= 1000 ) {
  name
  uid
}
```

To learn more, read [Functions](#functions-h2).

## Control structures

These are the control structures that organize the flow of control in MQL:

- [If](#if)
- [Switch](#switch)
- [Conditional operators](#conditional-operators)

### If

In MQL a simple `if` statement looks like this:

```coffee
if( x > 0 ) {
  return y
}
```

You can also chain statements with `else if` and `else`:

```coffee
if( x > 10 ) {
return 1
} else if( x > 0 ) {
return 0
} else {
return -1
}
```

### Switch

You can more easily chain multiple conditionals together using `switch`:

```coffee
switch( x ) {
case _ > 10:
  return 1
case _ > 0:
  return 0
default:
  return -1
}
```

MQL evaluates the cases from top to bottom until it finds a match. There is no automatic fall-through.

### Conditional operators

MQL supports these conditional operators:

- `==`
- `!=`
- `>`
- `<`
- `>=`
- `<=`

:::tip

Use `inRange` to check if an integer, float, or dict is in a numeric range. Follow this format:

```coffee
VALUE.inRange(MIN,  MAX)
```

Examples:

```coffee

3.inRange(3, 5)

password.length.inRange(9, 15)
```

:::

Although MQL is type-safe and compiled, it’s also forgiving. You can easily express your assertions without having to fight with the type-safety.

Here’s a simple example:

```coffee
a = 2
b = "2"

a == 2 && b == 2
```

Here’s a real-world example:

```coffee
sshd.config.params["Port"] == 22
```

`params` is a map of strings, so values like `Protocol` and `Port` are strings, even though they look like numbers.

Many conditional operators allow soft comparisons:

```coffee
"2" == 2

"2" == 2.0

"3" > 2

[1] == 1
```

This simplifies the usage of regular expressions as well:

```coffee
"Hello world" == /H.*o/
```

To learn about conditional operators with lists, see [Arrays](#arrays).

To learn about conditional operators with maps, see [Maps](#maps).

## Functions {#functions-h2}

- [Parameters](#parameters)
- [Anonymous functions](#anonymous-functions)

### Parameters

Many fields take unnamed parameters by default:

```coffee
sshd.config( "/path/to/my/sshd" )
```

You can also use named parameters to initialize resources.:

```coffee
parse.json(
  command('lsblk --json').stdout
)
```

### Anonymous functions

You can call many functions with an embedded function. An example is `where`:

```coffee
users.where( uid >= 1000 )
```

The function takes an embedded function as an argument, which is executed against it. The fields (in the above example, `uid`) are by default bound to the calling resource (in the above example, `user`).

You can combine these with global resources and variables:

```coffee
users.where( name == regex.email )
```

Some functions support both embedded and static values:

```coffee
[1,2,3].contains( 3 )
[1,2,3].contains( _ > 2 )
```

### Named arguments in functions

You can set a named argument in a function. This is useful in situations where you can only use one expression (such as with `all` or `one`). It also makes the code easier to understand, especially when nesting across multiple objects, as in this example:

```coffee
users.all(user:
  groups.contains(group:
    user.uid == group.gid
  )
)
```

## Data

Learn about these data types in MQL:

- [Basic data types](#basic-data-types)
- [Maps](#maps)
- [Dicts](#dicts)
- [Empty](#empty)

### Basic data types

MQL's basic data types are:

```coffee
s1 = "I am a string"
s2 = 'I am also a string'
re = /Reg.* Expression/

n1 = 1.0 + 2

n  = null
b  = true || false
```

#### Regular expressions

For regular expressions, you can access a lot of pre-built expressions in the `regex` resource. These are a few examples:

```coffee
"anya@forger.com" == regex.email

"10.0.0.255" == regex.ipv4
"fe80::1042:2c47:b787:f6bb" == regex.ipv6

"4832500902091714" == regex.creditCard
```

To learn about all the pre-build expressions, read the [`regex`](/mql/resources/core-pack/regex/) resource reference.

#### Time

MQL’s built-in time functions make these assertions easy:

```coffee
time.now
# 2022-10-13 14:42:35 -0700 PDT

time.now - time.day
# 2022-10-12 14:42:35 -0700 PDT
# subtracts a day from the current time

time.now - 2*time.hour
# 2022-10-13 11:42:35 -0700 PDT
# subtracts 2 hours from the current time

parse.date("2022-10-12T14:42:35Z")
# 2022-10-12 14:42:35 +0000 UTC
# uses RFC3339 layout by default
```

:::tip

Use `inRange` to check if a date and time is in a range. Follow this format:

```coffee
DATE.inRange(MIN, MAX)
```

Example:

```coffee
time.inRange(yesterday, tomorrow)
```

:::

MQL also can parse durations:

```coffee
parse.duration("3days")

parse.duration("1y")
```

Although the parser is very lenient, for best results, use:

```
30s = 30 seconds
1m = 1 minute
3h = 3 hours
90d = 90 days
5y = 5 years
```

#### Empty

The `empty` data type saves you the trouble of checking for different kinds of empty values, such as:

- `[]`
- `null`
- `''`
- `{}`

For example, this query finds any type of empty value:

```coffee
users.list == empty
```

#### Semantic versioning

Use the `semver` type for semantic versioning. Create a semver using the `semver` keyword, which takes a string as an argument:

```coffee
semver('3.12.1')
```

You can compare a semver with another semver or with a string:

```coffee
semver('1.2.3') < semver('2.3')

semver('1.10') >= '1.2'
```

### Arrays

Many resources contain lists of entries, like this example:

```coffee
users {
  name
  uid
}
```

You can filter these lists using the `where` clause:

```coffee
users.where( uid >= 1000 ) {
  name
  uid
}
```

#### Array assertions

To avoid unnecessary loops, MQL provides some keywords that make assertions on lists a lot simpler. For example:

```coffee
users.all( uid >= 0 )
```

Failures to these print the affected elements:

```coffee
> users.all( uid > 0 )
[failed] users.all()
  actual:   [
	0: user id = user/0/root
  ]
```

The available assertions for all lists are:

```coffee
users.all( name != "anya" )   <= make sure no user is called anya
users.one( name == "anya" )   <= one user must exist, but no more than one
users.none( name == "anya" )  <= no user exists with the name anya
users.contains( uid >= 1000 ) <= contains one or more users with uid >= 1000
```

For lists of strings, you can use the `in` assertion, which is the inverse of `contains`:

```coffee
"anya".in(["abel","amos","anya"])
```

An ideal use for `in` is to combine it with [properties](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/properties/). For example, if you define a property named `allowedCiphers`, you can assert that a configured cipher is in that list:

```coffee
sshd.config.ciphers.in( props.allowedCiphers )
```

Another useful assertion for lists of strings is `containsAll`:

```coffee
["abel","amos","anya"].containsAll(["abel","amos"])
```

#### Mapping field

With block extraction, MQL provides arrays of maps:

```coffee
> users { name }
[
  0: { name: "root" }

  ...

]
```

You can map these values into a simple list:

```coffee
> users.map(name)
[
  0: "root",

  ...

]
```

This makes many queries and assertions easier:

```coffee
users.map(name).contains( "anya" )
```

### Maps

_Maps_ are key-value structures in which the key is a string and the value can be any type. You can access individual fields using `[]` or get all `keys` and `values`

These are simple examples:

```coffee
m = {"a": 1, "b": 2}

> m.b
# 2

> m.keys
# ["a", "b"]

> m.values
# [1, 2]
```

This is a real-life example:

```
> os.env["SHELL"]
"/usr/bin/zsh"
```

#### Map assertions

The available assertions for maps are:

```coffee
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}.contains( key == 'b' )
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}.all( value > 0 )
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}.one( value != 1 )
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}.none( key == /d-f/ )
```

### Dicts

_Dicts_ are similar to maps but have one key difference: Maps are statically typed ahead of time; they have known value types.

That’s not the case when you process unknown data such as JSON. This presents a challenge, and the solution is `dict`:

```coffee
> parse.json("my.json")
parse.json.params: {
  1: 1.000000
  1.0: 1.000000
  _: null
  date: "2016-01-28T23:02:24Z"
  dict: {
	ee: 3.000000
	ej: 4.000000
	ek: 5.000000
  }

  ...

```

As you can see, there can be mixed values for all supported base types.

All other operations work as expected:

```coffee
> parse.json("my.json").params.keys
parse.json.params.keys: [
  0: "int-array"
  1: "f"
  2: "string-array"
  3: "hello"


> parse.json("my.json").params.value
parse.json.params.values: [
  0: null
  1: true
  2: 1.000000
  3: "hello"

> parse.json("my.json").params["f"][0]
parse.json.params[f][0]: {
  ff: 3.000000
}

> parse.json("my.json").
    params["f"].
    all( _.keys.contains("ff") )
[ok] value: true
```

#### `recurse` helper for dicts

The `recurse` helper makes it easy to extract data from a dict structure made up of mixed value types.

For example, suppose you need to retrieve all users from this JSON data structure:

```json
{
  "users": [{ "name": "bob" }],
  "owners": {
    "admins": [{ "name": "joy", "isOwner": true }]
  }
}
```

Because of the varying data types, finding users in this structure is difficult with traditional mechanisms. You need to understand the data structure and know where to search.

`recurse` eliminates that difficulty:

```coffee
jdata.recurse( name != empty )
```

```coffee
[
  0: {
    name: "bob"
  }
  1: {
    isOwner: true
    name: "joy"
  }
]
```

You can then map the user names:

```coffee
jdata.recurse( name != empty ).map(name)
```

```coffee
[
  0: "bob"
  1: "joy"
]
```

### Nested data

JSON, Terraform, and Kubernetes artifacts can include nested structures that make data a challenge to access. To make these easier to query, MQL supports simple accessors:

```coffee
tfblock {
  attributes.account_id.value
}
```

### Helpers for data type conversions

Helpers let you convert data to the type you need:

```coffee
> int(1.23)
1

> bool(1)
true

> float(12)
12

> string(1.89)
"1.89"

> regex("w.r.d") == "world 🌎"
/w.r.d/
```

## Error handling

For values that cannot be accessed, MQL provides errors:

```coffee
> file("/etc/shadow").content
[failed] file.content
  error: open /etc/shadow: permission denied
```

#### Null chaining

In general, `null` values are chained across their access:

```coffee
> sshd.config.params["NONE"].downcase == null
[ok] value: _
```

## Concurrency

MQL supports concurrent execution by default. All code that you write is executed in the order of its necessary I/O input.

For example:

```coffee
hosts = [
  tls("mondoo.com"),
  tls("mondoo.io"),
  ...
]

hosts.all(
  ciphers
    .none( /cbc/i )
)
```

This call checks all TLS ciphers on all the hosts that were previously defined. Such calls can take a while to execute if done serially. However, MQL looks for the entry points where data is being processed and executes those in parallel. In the example above, the TLS requests to all hosts will run in parallel and aggregate.

It doesn’t matter if the data is retrieved from an API, file, system command or other call; MQL always executes calls in parallel.

You don't have to configure or think about concurrency or parallel value assignment in MQL; concurrency is automatic on all available streams.

## Commenting

MQL supports `#` commenting, which works best with YAML.

```coffee
# I am a comment
sshd.config.params
```

MQL also supports `//`.

## Embedding

It’s easy to embed MQL in your code.

### CLI

A quick way to embed MQL is to execute MQL in the CLI and embed the results in other scripts:

```bash
> cnquery run local --json \
  -c "processes.where(command == /long test/).map(pid)" | ...
```

### Code embedding

You can embed the MQL execution engine as a dependency. This example embeds in Go:

```golang
package mqldiscovery

import (
	"go.mondoo.com/cnquery"
	"go.mondoo.com/cnquery/llx"
	"go.mondoo.com/cnquery/motor"
	aws_provider "go.mondoo.com/cnquery/motor/providers/aws"
	"go.mondoo.com/cnquery/mql"
	"go.mondoo.com/cnquery/resources"
	resource_pack "go.mondoo.com/cnquery/resources/packs/aws"
)

func New(provider *aws_provider.Provider) (*MqlDiscovery, error) {
	m, err := motor.New(provider)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	rt := resources.NewRuntime(resource_pack.Registry, m)
	return &MqlDiscovery{rt: rt}, nil
}

type MqlDiscovery struct {
	rt *resources.Runtime
}

func (md *MqlDiscovery) GetResourceCount(query string) int32 {
	mqlExecutor := mql.New(md.rt, cnquery.DefaultFeatures)
	value, err := mqlExecutor.Exec(query, map[string]*llx.Primitive{})
	if err != nil {
		return 0
	}

	a := 0
	d, _ := mapstructure.NewDecoder(&mapstructure.DecoderConfig{
		Result: &a,
	})
	d.Decode(value.Value)
	return int32(a)
}

func (md *MqlDiscovery) GetRegionsList() []string {
	mqlExecutor := mql.New(md.rt, cnquery.DefaultFeatures)
	value, err := mqlExecutor.Exec("aws.regions", map[string]*llx.Primitive{})
	if err != nil {
		return []string{}
	}

	a := []string{}
	d, _ := mapstructure.NewDecoder(&mapstructure.DecoderConfig{
		Result: &a,
	})
	d.Decode(value.Value)
	return a
}

func (md *MqlDiscovery) Close() {
	if md.rt != nil && md.rt.Motor != nil {
		md.rt.Motor.Close()
	}
}

func (md *MqlDiscovery) RunQuery(query string) interface{} {
	mqlExecutor := mql.New(md.rt, cnquery.DefaultFeatures)
	value, err := mqlExecutor.Exec(query, map[string]*llx.Primitive{})
	if err != nil {
		return nil
	}

	var a interface{}
	d, _ := mapstructure.NewDecoder(&mapstructure.DecoderConfig{
		Result: &a,
	})
	d.Decode(value.Value)
	return a
}
```
