We are excited to announce Mondoo v8, the new major release of cnspec, cnquery, and Mondoo Platform.

## 🚀 NEW POLICY EXPERIENCE

This release significantly improves policies and query packs by simplifying their structure and adding major new features like properties, variants, and embedded queries. We continue to keep the Mondoo upgrade process incredibly simple, so you don’t have to worry about moving to v8.

### Policies and query packs

**Problem:** Some of our old fields were confusing to use. For example: `query` defined the MQL query inside of the query with metadata. (Why use it twice?) The `scoring_queries` and `data_queries` inside policies were unnecessarily convoluted. And what were `specs`?

```yaml
policies
  - specs:
      - scoring_queries:
          sshd-01:
      - data_queries:
          sshd-02:
queries:
  - uid: sshd-01:
    query: sshd.config.params["StrictModes"] == "yes"
  - uid: sshd-02:
    query: sshd.config.params
```

**Solution:** We have overhauled a lot of commonly used terms in policies and query packs. Queries now contain an `mql` field to store the MQL snippet. Policies are now built around `groups` that can generate chapters and contain `checks` (which are scored) and `queries` (which are not scored). Additionally, we have removed all instances of key-value maps (see `sshd-01:` above) and replaced them with named fields (see `- uid: sshd-01` below).

```yaml
policies:
  - groups:
      - checks:
          - uid: sshd-01
      - queries:
          - uid: sshd-02
queries:
  - uid: sshd-01
    mql: sshd.config.params["StrictModes"] == "yes"
  - uid: sshd-02
    mql: sshd.config.params
```

**Problem:** The old YAML files we used in cnspec and cnquery required users to create references for queries and checks to use them. This forced people to write policies and separately reference all queries they wanted to use. See the example above.

**Solution:** We have introduced embedded queries. It’s now much easier to write policies that stand on their own. You don’t have to explicitly reference queries and checks anymore. Instead, you can embed queries and checks directly into the policy that describes them.

```yaml
policies:
  - groups:
      - checks: # embedded query vv
          - uid: sshd-01
            mql: sshd.config.params["StrictModes"] == "yes"
      - queries:
          - uid: sshd-02
            mql: sshd.config.params
```

If you want to re-use queries, you can continue to use them globally as well, as seen above. If you prefer not to set a `uid` for any of these embedded queries and checks, cnspec generates one for you: Just run `cnspec bundle format FILENAME`. Stable UIDs (and, in turn, MRNs) are still important for anyone who uses your policy and defines overrides, exceptions, or processes policy results.

**Problem:** The ability to override queries and checks was very limiting. You could only affect a limited number of fields and had to understand how these were referenced. (We will skip the example to avoid even more confusion.)

**Solution:** Making changes to individual queries is now simple and intuitive. For example, here is a globally shared query that is modified in a policy:

```yaml
policies:
  - groups:
      - checks:
          # reference the shared query and change its title and impact
          - uid: sshd-01
            title: Make sure to enforce StrictMode
            impact: 80

queries:
  - uid: sshd-01
    mql: sshd.config.params["StrictModes"] == "yes"
    impact: 50
```

**Problem:** Policies containing a lot of queries flooded users with an unstructured list of all of their contents. However, most policy documents aren’t written this way. Instead, they contain chapters and sections that group together checks and controls.

**Solution:** Policy groups now have a `type` to specify their function. For example, the most common type in a policy is a `chapter`:

```yaml
policies:
  - uid: policy1
    groups:
      - type: chapter
        title: Kernel checks
        docs:
          desc: |
            Long description about what kernel checks do...
        checks:
          - uid: kernel-check-01
            ...
```

Other types include `import` (for referencing imported policies) and `override` (for making changes to any policies, queries, and checks).

### Properties

Properties are a way to make adjustments to existing queries in pre-defined ways. For example, you can change the list of allowed TLS ciphers to include ciphers you need or you can change the location of files that are tested.

Properties existed before v8, but weren’t exposed to users. With this release we make properties configurable in the CLI, with configuration in the UI to follow in the coming weeks.

**Configuration**

Policy authors can add properties to their queries in YAML using `props`:

```yaml
- uid: home-info
  mql: file(props.home) { * }
  title: Gather info about the user's home
  props:
    - uid: home
      mql: |
        "/home"
```

The `uid` is required. It provides the name for accessing properties in MQL. These follow standards for identifiers (such as no spaces or control characters allowed).

**CLI usage**

By default, the query uses the configured property. If you want to adjust it, such as for the above example, you can use the `--props` CLI argument:

```bash
cnspec scan -f examples/example.mql.yaml --props "home='/home/zero'"
```

Note: This example overwrites a string property. Doing this properly requires escaping the CLI arguments so they retain the quotation (`’`) characters in MQL. Properties can be any MQL snippet, but must adhere to the expected type. For example: You can't overwrite a string property into a number.

### Deprecations

All deprecations will be supported throughout the lifetime of Mondoo v8. We will remove them when we release Mondoo v9.

- With the new policy format established in this release, we are deprecating the old policy format. If you only use existing policies created and maintained by Mondoo, you don’t need to take any action. We are serving both v7 and v8 clients and will keep things compatible.
- If you have written your own policies, these will automatically work with v7 and v8 clients after you upload them to the Policy Hub. To take advantage of the many simplifications and features we have added, we encourage you to convert your policies to v8 with this simple command:

  ```bash
  cnspec bundle format FILE
  ```

  The formatter in cnspec always store files in the latest format.

- All public policies in our [community repo](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec-policies) will remain in the v7 format for a little longer. This is to support users who are still using v7 and manually downloading policy files. We will transition these policies throughout the v8 lifespan to allow some new capabilities, like configurable properties, context, and variants.

## 🎉 OTHER NEW FEATURES

### Continuous scanning of Google Workspace and Okta

You can now continuously scan your Google Workspace and Okta SaaS environments directly from the Mondoo Console. There's nothing to download or install in order to get started. Set up integrations with service accounts or tokens for these SaaS services, and they will securely scan every 8 hours.

![New Integrations](/img/releases/2023-03-08-mondoo-8.0-is-out/integrations.png)

### Scan GCP orgs, projects, and folders

No matter what you want to inspect in your GCP infrastructure, Mondoo has your back with new scanning support from your whole organization&mdash;down to a single folder:

```bash
cnquery scan gcp org 342423 # <-- scan GCP organization
cnquery scan gcp project mondoo-dev # <-- scan GCP project
cnquery scan gcp folder 3421423 # <-- scan GCP folder
```

### Secure your GKE control plane

There's more to Cloud Kubernetes security than just the kubelet and cluster workloads, so we've added new data-gathering capabilities for the GKE control plan. Use this new data to take inventory of your GKE configuration or to write custom security policies for your organization.

]
```

### Identify public IPs in Azure

Identifying publicly exposed assets is critical to securing your cloud infrastructure. Use the new `publicIpAddresses` data available in the `azure.subscription.computeservice.vm` and `azure.subscription.networkservice` to quickly identify assets that may be incorrectly publicly exposed.

Identify all public IP addresses in a subscription:

```coffeescript
cnquery> azure.subscription.network.publicIpAddresses{*}
azure.subscription.network.publicIpAddresses: [
  0: {
    name: "super-cool-public-ip"
    id: "/subscriptions/<redacted>/resourceGroups/<redacted>/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/<redacted>"
    location: "uksouth"
    tags: {}
    ipAddress: "255.255.255.255"
  }
]
```

Identify public IP addresses on specific VMs:

```coffeescript
cnquery> azure.subscription.compute.vms{publicIpAddresses{*}}
azure.subscription.compute.vms: [
  0: {
    publicIpAddresses: [
      0: {
        name: "super-cool-public-ip"
        id: "/subscriptions/<redacted>/resourceGroups/<redacted>/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/<redacted>"
        location: "uksouth"
        tags: {}
        ipAddress: "255.255.255.255"
      }
    ]
    name: "vm-name"
  }
]
```

### Query Google Workspace connected apps

You can now fetch Google Workspace connected apps with a new `googleworkspace.connectedApps` MQL resource:

```coffeescript
googleworkspace.connectedApps { name clientid }
googleworkspace.connectedApps: [
  0: {
    clientId: "11234434534-abcdefg.apps.googleusercontent.com"
    name: "Slack"
  }
  ...
]
```

You can also filter this data to return specific connected apps:

```coffeescript
googleworkspace.connectedApps.where( name == /Slack/) { * }
googleworkspace.connectedApps.where: [
  0: {
    users: [
  0: googleworkspace.user primaryEmail="user1@example.com"
    ]
    tokens: [
  0: googleworkspace.token displayText="Slack"
    ]
    scopes: [
      0: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/activity"
      1: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.activity"
      2: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile"
      3: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"
      4: "openid"
      5: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly"
      6: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"
      7: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events"
    ]
    name: "Slack"
    clientId: "11234434534-abcdefg.apps.googleusercontent.com"
  }
  1: {
    users: [
  0: googleworkspace.user primaryEmail="user1@example.com"
  1: googleworkspace.user primaryEmail="user2@example.com"
  2: googleworkspace.user primaryEmail="user3@example.com"
  3: googleworkspace.user primaryEmail="user4@example.com"
    ]
    tokens: [
  0: googleworkspace.token displayText="Slack"
  1: googleworkspace.token displayText="Slack"
  2: googleworkspace.token displayText="Slack"
  3: googleworkspace.token displayText="Slack"
    ]
    scopes: [
      0: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile"
      1: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"
      2: "openid"
    ]
    name: "Slack"
    clientId: "3321342421-abcdefg.apps.googleusercontent.com"
  }
  2: {
    users: [
  0: googleworkspace.user primaryEmail="user1@example.com"
  1: googleworkspace.user primaryEmail="user2@example.com"
  2: googleworkspace.user primaryEmail="user3@example.com"
  3: googleworkspace.user primaryEmail="user4@example.com"
    ]
    tokens: [
  0: googleworkspace.token displayText="Slack"
  1: googleworkspace.token displayText="Slack"
  2: googleworkspace.token displayText="Slack"
  3: googleworkspace.token displayText="Slack"
    ]
    scopes: [
      0: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile"
      1: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"
      2: "openid"
    ]
    name: "Slack"
    clientId: "6060606090-abcdefg.apps.googleusercontent.com"
  }
]
```

### Python packages inspection

Outdated packages don't end at the operating system, so we've introduced our first application package resource with the `python.packages` MQL resource. This new resource discovers packages automatically on macOS, Windows, and Linux in the following locations:

- /usr/local/lib/python/\*
- /usr/local/lib64/python/\*
- /usr/lib/python/\*
- /usr/lib64/python/\*
- /opt/homebrew/lib/python/\*
- C:/Python/\*
- /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions
- /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions

Each package returns data similar to this `pytz` package:

```coffeescript
cnquery> python.packages[0]{ * }
python.packages[0]: {
  author: "Armin Ronacher"
  name: "Babel"
  dependencies: [
  0: python.package name="pytz" version="2022.7.1"
  ]
  summary: "Internationalization utilities"
  id: "/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/Babel-2.10.3-py3.11.egg-info/PKG-INFO"
  file: file path="/usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/Babel-2.10.3-py3.11.egg-info/PKG-INFO" size=1283 permissions.string="-rw-r--r--"
  license: "BSD"
  version: "2.10.3"
}
```

To query a specific package on disk you can provide the path to the METADATA file:

```coffeescript
cnquery> python.package("/home/jdiaz/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/python_ftp_server-1.3.17.dist-info/METADATA"){ * }
python.package: {
  version: "1.3.17"
  summary: "Command line FTP server tool designed for performance and ease of use."
  file: file path="/home/jdiaz/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/python_ftp_server-1.3.17.dist-info/METADATA" size=1186 permissions.string="-rw-r--r--"
  author: "Vadym Stupakov"
  dependencies: data is not a map to auto-expand
  id: "/home/jdiaz/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/python_ftp_server-1.3.17.dist-info/METADATA"
  license: "MIT"
  name: "python-ftp-server"
}
```

This is the first of many new application package resources we plan to introduce, allowing you to audit and secure your application dependencies. If you have particular application packaging systems you want to see in cnquery and cnspec, be sure to let us know on our [GitHub Discussions page](https://github.com/orgs/mondoohq/discussions).

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Support for connecting to IPv6 hosts

Some day we'll all take the leap and migrate to IPv6. When you do, Mondoo will be there for you. We've updated both cnquery and cnspec to connect to IPv6 hosts directly over SSH or using Ansible inventory files.

```
cnquery shell ssh chris@fd00::20c:30ff:fe8a:9da0 --ask-pass
Enter password:
→ discover related assets for 1 asset(s)
→ resolved assets resolved-assets=1
  ___ _ __   __ _ _   _  ___ _ __ _   _
 / __| '_ \ / _` | | | |/ _ \ '__| | | |
| (__| | | | (_| | |_| |  __/ |  | |_| |
 \___|_| |_|\__, |\__,_|\___|_|   \__, |
  mondoo™      |_|                |___/  interactive shell

cnquery>
```

### Expanded support for AWS ECS in MQL

In this release we've greatly expanded MQL's AWS ECS support with new data and resources:

- `aws.ecs.task` now includes `platformVersion` data.
- `aws.ecs.container` now includes `platformVersion`, `runtimeId`, and `containerName` data.
- `aws.ecs.cluster` now includes `containerInstances` data.
- `aws.ecs.image` now includes `uri` data exposing the URI of the image repository.
- New `aws.ecs.instance` resource.

### New and improved policies

- **New** Microsoft 365 Security by Mondoo

  This all-new policy by Mondoo helps you to secure your Microsoft 365 configuration.

- **New** Microsoft Vulnerability Policy by Mondoo

  This all-new policy helps you find critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office and SharePoint.

- **New** VMware vCenter Incident Response Pack

  Gather critical information on your vSphere and ESXi systems in the event of a security incident with this new incident response pack.

- **Updated** CIS Microsoft 365 Foundations Benchmark from 1.2 to 1.5

  This updated policy is nearly entirely rewritten with dozens of new controls, more reliable queries, and updated remediation steps.

- **Updated** CIS Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Benchmark to 1.3.0

  This updated policy includes new policies for securing not just the Kubelets, but now also the Kubernetes control plane.

- **Updated** CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark policy

  Ten updated controls in the CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark policy improve the reliability of results.

- **Updated** Microsoft Azure Security

  We added nine new queries to the Microsoft Azure Security to help you better secure the base directory configuration.

- **Updated** Linux Workstation Security

  We expanded boot loader security to include permissions on `/boot/loader/loader.conf` so you can rest assured your boot sequence hasn't been tampered with.

- **Updated** Linux Security Policy

  We improved the reliability of auditd package checks on some SUSE releases.

### Specify GCP and Google Workspace credential path

You can now specify the path to your GCP or Google Workspace credentials using a new `--credentials-path` flag. Shell environmental variables will continue to take precedence when defining the path, but this is a great method of setting the path if you don't have shell ENV vars set.

With env var:

```bash
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/mondoo-dev-1111111.json cnquery shell gcp
```

With --credentials-path:

```bash
cnquery shell gcp --credentials-path ~/mondoo-dev-1111111.json
```

### Find spaces more easily in large organizations

It was hard to find a particular asset when you had a large number of organizations or spaces. We've made things easier to track down with new links to open individual organizations and alphabetical sorting of all spaces.

![New Sorting of Spaces](/img/releases/2023-03-08-mondoo-8.0-is-out/sorted_spaces.png)

### Login with a splash

Our old login page didn't feel fancy enough, so we redesigned it with splashes of Mondoo purple and orange to spruce up your login experience.

![New Login Screen](/img/releases/2023-03-08-mondoo-8.0-is-out/new_login.png)

### Red Hat Universal Base Image cnspec containers on Docker Hub

We are now publishing Red Hat Universal Base Image-based cnspec and cnquery containers to Docker Hub. These containers are perfect for running cnspec and cnquery in OpenShift clusters. You can find these images along with our standard Alpine-based images in our [cnspec](https://hub.docker.com/r/mondoo/cnspec) and [cnquery](https://hub.docker.com/r/mondoo/cnquery) repositories.

### Improved scan error output

Gone are cryptic asset connection error messages when scanning multiple assets! In their place you now see better formatted and parsed error messages that make it easier to track down exactly why assets can't be scanned.

![Better error output](/img/releases/2023-03-08-mondoo-8.0-is-out/better_errors.png)

## 🐛 BUG FIXES AND UPDATES
