ü•≥ mondoo 5.6.0 is out!

üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

- Windows 2022 support
- Extended the audit and remediation documentation on the AWS policy
- Update "Mondoo Platform End-of-Life Policy" to use the `sh` built-in `command` instead of `which` to determine if an executable is in the path since not all platforms have which by default
- New to the MQL time resource: `time.today` and `time.tomorrow`
- Improve AWS CIS Operational Best Practices policies with more descriptions
- Include SuSE and macOS AWS EC2 instances in integration statistics overview
- Improved the messaging on the AWS integration when in an unhealthy state

üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Community uploaded policies are now always marked as private
- Fix an issue where duplicated queries across policies would not be correctly reported
- Fix an issue where asset connection issues in discovery phase where reported but have not lead to exit code 1
- Fix AWS instance tag filter for SSM integration
- Fix operator precedence bug where a query like: `false && false || true` resulted in a `false` value
- Fixed issue where a portion of the app would spin when a failed token refresh resulted in a 401
- Handle case where non-reachable assets detected in discovery phase were not used for exit codes
- Properly error out when we could not retrieve the platform details for arista

‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGES:

- Modified the AWS integration Mondoo Lambda role to have stricter permissions. This change requires users to _manually update the CloudFormation_ by navigating to the AWS CloudFormation console and selecting the `Update` button. No additional configuration options are required.
