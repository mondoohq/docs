With cnquery, you can explore and interrogate your entire Azure tenant. It's like having a powerful search engine for your Azure environment. For example, you can analyze databases or search for Azure Network Interface configuration details... all with a single tool.

cnquery provides the answers you need about every Azure configuration. For a list of Azure resources you can query, read [Mondoo Azure Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/azure-pack/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core-pack/).

## Connect cnquery with your Azure environment

### Requirements

To explore your Azure environment with cnquery, you must have:

- [cnquery installed on your workstation](/cnquery/)
- An [Azure subscription](https://cloud.google.com/free)
- The [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed

### Log into Azure

Using the Azure CLI, log into your subscription:

```bash
az login
```

### Verify with an Azure query

To quickly confirm that cnquery has access to your Azure environment, run this query from your terminal:

```bash
cnquery run azure -c 'azure.resources'
```

## Query an Azure project

To answer any question about your environment, use cnquery's interactive shell. It has auto-complete to guide you, which is especially helpful when you're new to cnquery and learning MQL.

To launch a shell into your Azure environment, enter:

```bash
cnquery shell azure
```

### Discover capabilities with the `help` command

Once inside the shell, use the `help` command to learn what Azure subscription resources you can query. This command lists all the Azure subscription resources:

```coffeescript
help azure.subscription
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down further. For example, enter this command to list all the Azure PostgreSQL resources you can query:

```coffeescript
help azure.subscription.postgreSql
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down even further. You can also learn about available Azure resources in the [Mondoo Azure Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/azure-pack/).

### Query storage accounts

Now that you know how to discover what's possible with cnquery, let's run some actual queries in the shell.

This query lists all the storage accounts in the project:

```coffeescript
azure.subscription.storage.accounts
```

#### Request full details in results

For a more detailed report, you can specify that you want all fields:

```coffeescript
azure.subscription.storage.accounts { * }
```

For every account, cnquery provides information about their status and settings.

#### Specify fields to include in results

If you're interested in only some details, specify the fields you want in braces. For example, this query asks for each user's ARN, when they last changed their password, and whether they have MFA enabled:

```coffeescript
azure.subscription.storage.accounts { id type properties }
```

#### Filter results

You can filter results based on any fields. Specify the criteria using the `where` function and standard boolean operators.

For example, this filters results based on status:

```coffeescript
azure.subscription.storage.accounts.where(kind == "BlobStorage") { id name type }
```

cnquery returns all BlobStorage accounts. It includes the ID, name and type for each one.
