## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### New compliance exceptions UI

We've reworked the compliance exceptions system to make it easier to understand when exceptions have been set and what that means for your compliance data collection.

Each control includes a new **Set Exception** button so you can quickly create exceptions directly from framework control pages.

![Set Exception](/img/releases/2023-11-14-mondoo-9.7.0-is-out/set_exception.png)

For controls with an exception set, the UI now communicates which type of exception has been set: snooze or disable. It gives a quick description of how the exception affects compliance data collection. The details of the exception are also shown directly on the control page, allowing you to accept, reject, or delete the exception without needing to dig through the exceptions tab.

### Run local query packs from cnspec

Want to quickly test a custom query pack you've written? Now it's easier than ever because you can run a local query pack directly from cnspec:

```text
cnspec scan -f example-pack.mql.yaml
‚Üí no provider specified, defaulting to local. Use --help to see all providers.
‚Üí loaded configuration from /Users/tsmith/.config/mondoo/mondoo.yml using source default
‚Üí using service account credentials
‚Üí discover related assets for 1 asset(s)

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Atlassian asset grouping

Atlassian admin, Jira, Confluence, and SCM assets scanned with cnspec are now grouped as Atlassian assets in the console. This helps you quickly find all your Atlassian assets.

### Ubuntu 23.10 EOL/CVE detection

Ubuntu 23.10 is out, and Mondoo is ready with EOL reporting and CVE detection now available for this latest Ubuntu release. See our blog post [What's New in Security for Ubuntu 23.10](https://mondoo.com/blog/whats-new-in-security-for-ubuntu-23-10) to learn more about this release's great new security features.

### Raspbian 11 and 12 CVE detection

cnspec scans on Raspbian 11.x and 12.x releases now include important CVE data on both the CLI and in the console, so you can keep your Raspberry Pi hobby and IoT projects secure.

### Better application of CIS Distribution Independent Linux Benchmark policy

The CIS Distribution Independent Linux Benchmark policy is a fantastic alternative Linux security policy to use when your operating system distribution or specific version is not supported by one of the main CIS Linux benchmarks. Thanks to new filters, you can now apply this policy in any space and rest assured it will only apply to systems for which more specific CIS benchmark policies aren't available. This means that now you can always have security and compliance data available, even when you're running distros that are a bit off the beaten path, such as non-LTS Ubuntu releases, Arch Linux, or Raspbian.

### New AWS resource fields

AWS resources include new default values to improve data pack queries and navigation in the cnquery/cnspec shell. The resources also have many new fields to expose valuable asset inventory data:

[aws.cloudfront.distribution](/mql/resources/aws-pack/aws.cloudfront.distribution/)

- enabled
- httpVersion
- isIPV6Enabled
- priceClass

[aws.dynamodb.table](/mql/resources/aws-pack/aws.dynamodb.table/)

- createdAt
- deletionProtectionEnabled
- globalTableVersion
- id

[aws.accessanalyzer.analyzer](/mql/resources/aws-pack/aws.accessanalyzer.analyzer/)

- createdAt
- lastResourceAnalyzed
- lastResourceAnalyzedAt

[aws.autoscaling.group](/mql/resources/aws-pack/aws.autoscaling.group/)

- region

[aws.backup.vault](/mql/resources/aws-pack/aws.backup.vault/)

- createdAt
- encryptionKeyArn
- locked
- region
