## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Full-text search of assets, vulnerabilities, policies, and more

Expand search from just assets to everything in your Mondoo organization. New full-text search allows you to find spaces, assets, checks, CVEs, and vendor advisories with plain text searches.

Curious what Mondoo knows about RDS in your environment? Search for "RDS" to quickly see RDS database instances and the specific RDS checks applied in any space:

### Scan AWS however you please

Life is all about choice! At Mondoo we think how you scan your assets should be up to you. Thats's why we're extending our existing AWS scanning capabilities to include a new Mondoo-hosted AWS integration, allowing you to quickly set up AWS account scanning without the installation of agent code.

Our existing serverless (Lambda) integration is still available. It provides a higher level of security as well as advanced instance scanning capabilities. To help you decide which is best for you, the AWS integration setup page breaks down the pros and cons of each scanning method.

If you're already using the existing serverless AWS integration, don't feel left out. A whole new integration page management experience awaits you to better expose the current configuration, potential scanning errors, and discovered assets. You can also name your new or existing integrations with more human-friendly titles... because no one should have to remember which 12-digit Amazon account ID belongs to production and which is dev.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server support

Secure your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible servers with expanded Azure Database support in Mondoo. Query database instance configuration with the new `azure.subscription.postgreSql.flexibleServers` resource or ensure proper security settings have been applied with updates to the CIS Azure Foundation benchmark policies and the Mondoo Azure Security policy.
