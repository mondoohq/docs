Your _security posture_ is your organization's ability to identify, respond to, and recover from security threats and risks. Do you understand your current security posture? Do you know what your greatest risks are right now? Do you know exactly how to eliminate those risks? With Mondoo, the answer is always "Yes."

Mondoo continuously assesses the security of your infrastructure based on security policies that you select. These policies are the standards to which you hold your organization, benchmarks you want your systems to meet. Mondoo is always evaluating your security performance against these policies and providing both high-level and detailed data on your current risk. Based on Mondoo's security data and detailed mitigation instructions, you can close security gaps and eliminate risks.
