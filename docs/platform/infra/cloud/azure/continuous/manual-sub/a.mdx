This is the first step in the manual setup for an Azure subscription.


## Step A: Register an app with Microsoft Entra ID and create a service principal

1. Log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as a global administrator, application administrator or cloud application administrator.

2. Find and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

3. In the navigation sidebar, select **App registrations**.

5. Enter an application name (such as `mondoo-security`) and select **Accounts in this organizational directory only** as the supported account type. Mondoo does not require an application redirect URI.

6. Select the **Register** button.

   Microsoft creates the application ID and displays it in the application registration overview.
