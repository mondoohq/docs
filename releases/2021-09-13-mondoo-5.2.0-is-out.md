🥳 mondoo 5.2.0 is out!

🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

- CIS Distribution Independent Linux has been updated and includes many improvements around pam controls, speedier implementation of the CIS controls that have to scan the whole file system
- MSI Installation has been improved. We changed the default behavior for service start. By default windows services are not started after the MSI has been installed. For server setups, please configure the service to start automatically. See [docs](/cnspec/cnspec-oper/cnspec-windows-intro/) for more information
- RPM/Debian packages have been improved. They do not start the service by default anymore, the systemd unit is created but not enabled by default. Activated services are honored and restarted after package update is completed.
- Updated the getting-started walk-through for a new space.
