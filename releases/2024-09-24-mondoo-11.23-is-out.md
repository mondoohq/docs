## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Create Cases automatically on asset drift

When scans go from passing to failing, you want to know quickly. Mondoo now automatically creates work items to investigate checks and vulnerability scans that have gone from previously passing to failing, and assigns that work via ticketing systems, so teams can respond rapidly to suspicious changes on any asset.

### GitHub, GitLab, and email ticketing

Mondoo users can now group security findings into cases and assign those cases to external ticket systems for efficient tracking and resolution. Mondoo now additionally supports creating tickets in GitHub Issues and GitLab Issues, as well as sending ticket notifications via email. These options join our existing support for ticketing with Jira & Zendesk.
