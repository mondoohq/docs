Removing this from the docs for now because we don't support it. However, we will support it soon. So I'm stashing this content in this file that DOES NOT GET COMPILED for safe keeping.

## Apply a filter to a policy

The policy in this bundle has a filter:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```yaml showLineNumbers
policies:
  - uid: ssh-with-filter
    name: SSH policy that uses a filter

...

    groups:
      - title: my-group
        checks:
          - uid: sshd-01
            title: Ensure the port is set to 22
            mql: sshd.config.params["Port"] == 22
            impact: 30

          - uid: sshd-02
            title: Prevent weaker CBC ciphers from being used
            mql: sshd.config.ciphers.none( /cbc/ )
            impact: 60

        queries:
          - uid: sshd-d-1
            title: Gather SSH config params
            mql: sshd.config.params

        filters:
          - mql: asset.family.contains('unix')
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This bundle contains only one policy, `ssh-with-filter`. The section beginning on line 24 defines _filters_ for the policy. In this case, cnspec uses the policy to scan only assets that are based on UNIX (Linux distributions and macOS).
