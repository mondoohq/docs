Filters can specify what target assets a policy, group, check, or query can run against. A filter is simply a condition, written in [MQL](/mql/mql.write/), that must be met. Any fields you can query about any [resources](/mql/resources/) can be the basis for a filter.

The most common basis for filters is platform information. For example, you can add a filter that tells cnspec to run a policy only on AWS EKS clusters. Or you can add a filter that tells cnspec to run a check only on certain versions of an operating system.

Filters are an essential part of creating variants. To learn about variants, read [Make Policies Flexible with Variants](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/variants).

## Apply a filter to a check or query

Add `filters` information to a check or query to apply a filter to it.

This is an example of a check with a filter:

```yaml
- uid: ssh-root-login-is-disabled
  title: Ensure SSH root login is disabled
  filters: package('openssh-server').installed
  impact: 90
  mql: sshd.config.params["PermitRootLogin"] == "no"
```

The filter in the `ssh-root-login-is-disabled` check tells cnspec to run the check only on assets that have the SSH Server package installed. When scanning an asset without SSH Server, cnspec skips this check.

## Apply a filter to a chapter or group

Add `filters` information to a group to apply a filter to it.

This is an example of a [chapter](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/chapters) type of group with two filters:

```yaml
groups:
  - title: AWS Compute Services
    type: chapter
    filters: |
      asset.name == "aws"
      asset.kind == "api"
    checks:

    ...

```

Unless the asset is an AWS compute service, cnspec skips all the checks and queries in this group when scanning the asset.

## Apply a filter to a policy

The policy in this bundle has a filter:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```yaml showLineNumbers
policies:
  - uid: ssh-with-filter
    name: SSH policy that uses a filter

...

    groups:
      - title: my-group
        checks:
          - uid: sshd-01
            title: Ensure the port is set to 22
            mql: sshd.config.params["Port"] == 22
            impact: 30

          - uid: sshd-02
            title: Prevent weaker CBC ciphers from being used
            mql: sshd.config.ciphers.none( /cbc/ )
            impact: 60

        queries:
          - uid: sshd-d-1
            title: Gather SSH config params
            mql: sshd.config.params

        filters:
          - mql: asset.family.contains('unix')
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This bundle contains only one policy, `ssh-with-filter`. The section beginning on line 24 defines _filters_ for the policy. In this case, cnspec uses the policy to scan only assets that are based on UNIX (Linux distributions and macOS).

import Partial from "./_include-lint.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

## More examples of filters

This filter limits scans to only GCP projects:

```coffeescript
asset.platform == "gcp-project"
```

This filter limits scans to only kubelets:

```coffeescript
asset.family.contains('linux')
processes.where( executable == /kubelet/ ).list != []
```

To learn how to write your own filters, read [Write Effective MQL](/mql/mql.write/) and the [MQL Reference](/mql/resources/).
