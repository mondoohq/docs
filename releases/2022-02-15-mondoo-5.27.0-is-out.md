ü•≥ mondoo 5.27.0 is out!

### üéâ NEW FEATURES

<b> ESXi command resource </b>

Connect to a specific ESXi host:

```bash
mondoo shell -t vsphere://root@192.168.178.30 --ask-pass --discover host-machines --platform-id //platformid.api.mondoo.app/runtime/vsphere/instance/ha-host/moid/HostSystem-ha-host
```

Then run the command and retrieve the results:

```coffeescript
mondoo> esxi.command("system coredump network get").result
esxi.command.result: [
  0: {
    Enabled: "false"
    HostVNic: ""
    IsUsingIPv6: "false"
    NetworkServerIP: ""
    NetworkServerPort: "0"
  }
]
```

When you connect to vSphere's API you can combine the resource with each host:

```coffeescript
vsphere.datacenters {
  hosts {
    inventoryPath
    esxi.command(command: "system coredump network get", inventoryPath: inventoryPath).result
  }
}
```

### üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

- Linux policy updates
- New vulnerability report api, UI view coming soon!
- Split the VMware policy between vsphere and vsphere-esxi

### üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- AWS integration: fix `AddPermissions` error recorded in CloudWatch logs when trying to update the Lambda function policy
