🥳 Mondoo 5.34.1 is out. The big features this release: User defined asset tags and new Mondoo.com API endpoints

## 🚚 Mondoo domain change

Mondoo has moved to .com! As of April 12th we’ve officially migrated our web console to https://console.mondoo.com and API to `https://us.api.mondoo.com`. The previous URL’s will redirect to the new locations until they are EOL'ed later this year. We encourage you to update your bookmarks and Mondoo Client configurations. All-new configurations generated by Mondoo will use the new API location.

Mondoo 5.34.1 includes a migrate sub-command that can automatically update your Mondoo configuration to the new API endpoint:

```bash
## Check which API Endpoint we're using:
$ cat .config/mondoo/mondoo.yml | yq .api_endpoint
https://api.mondoo.app

## Upgrade the config:
$ mondoo migrate
→ Migrate Mondoo CLI configuration:
→ loaded configuration from /home/benr/.config/mondoo/mondoo.yml
→ saving mondoo config path=/home/benr/.config/mondoo/mondoo.yml
→ migrated configuration successfully

## Check the new API endpoint:
$ cat .config/mondoo/mondoo.yml | yq .api_endpoint
https://us.api.mondoo.com                                               # <-- Good!
```

## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### **Improved EOL OS detection**

Mondoo now includes improved end-of-life operating systems detection with new VMware Photon / Oracle Linux support and updated EOL information for Ubuntu, Scientific Linux, Fedora, and macOS.

### **Kubernetes Operator improvements**

Our preview Kubernetes Operator release 0.2.3 shipped with several improvements for added reliability in scanning:

- Operator pods now include readiness probes.
- Operator status information reports in the `MondooAuditConfig` CR
- Users can now skip the resolution of the Mondoo Client container image if necessary.
- Operator resource limits have been lowered to limit cluster impact.

### **Updated output in `mondoo policy` commands**

The `mondoo policy describe` and `mondoo policy list` commands have been updated with a fresh new output format to improve readability. `mondoo policy list` now also includes policy version information, and a new `--list-all` flag lets you list all private, public, and enabled policies at once.
