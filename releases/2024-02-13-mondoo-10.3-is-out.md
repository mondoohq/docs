## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Microsoft application CVE detection

Expose additional critical vulnerabilities on your workstations and servers with new application vulnerability detection for Microsoft Edge, .NET Framework, and Visual Studio Code. Mondoo automatically flags vulnerable releases on the asset's Software tab. Links to relevant CVEs and Microsoft KB advisories help you understand the risk of outdated software releases in your environment.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Paginate affected assets

Have thousands of systems impacted by a security check? No problem with new asset pagination on the security check pages.

### Performance improvements

We refactored how Mondoo initiates scans, compiles CVE data, and executes the shell to make sure you get the best security results without waiting.

### Reverse IP Lookup PTR record check in the Email Security policy

Gmail now requires a reverse IP Lookup PTR record for your domain to accept emails. The Mondoo Email Security policy now includes a new "Ensure Reverse IP Lookup PTR record is set (DNS Forward confirmed)" check so you can validate your domain is ready for these new stringent Gmail requirements.

### Vulnerability data on Pop!\_OS

Mondoo now supports CVE detection for Pop!\_OS, the Ubuntu-derived distribution for System76 laptops.

### Ubuntu 24.04 EOL and CVE support

Mondoo now detects the EOL date for the upcoming Ubuntu 24.04 release as well as package CVE data. The Ubuntu release doesn't come out until April, but this way you'll be secure from day one.
