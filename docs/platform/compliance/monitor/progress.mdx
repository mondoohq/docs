Mondoo continuously assesses your compliance. At any time, you can:

- View up-to-date information on whether your infrastructure complies with your chosen [frameworks](/platform/compliance/monitor/frameworks/)

- See a space's overall compliance and drill down into the details for different [controls, checks](/platform/compliance/monitor/frameworks/), and assets

- Generate a report to export or print evidence of (or progress toward) compliance

## View a space's compliance progress

Mondoo expresses overall compliance as a percentage. A space is compliant with a framework only when it reaches 100%. Lower percentages show _progress_ toward full compliance.

View a space's progress toward compliance with all available frameworks on the Compliance page:

1.  In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the space where you want to enable the policies.

2.  In the side navigation bar, under **Compliance**, select **Frameworks**.

    ![Compliance in the Mondoo Console](/img/platform/compliance/home.png)

    The Compliance page shows all available frameworks and the space's progress toward compliance with each of them.

## View evidence of compliance

From the Compliance Frameworks page, you can select a framework to learn more about the space's compliance with that framework.

**COMPLETION** shows overall progress toward compliance.

**CONTROL DISTRIBUTION** shows a high-level view of the state of controls in the framework: enabled, snoozed, and disabled. To learn about control states, read [Customize Compliance](/platform/compliance/customize/overview/).

Using the tabs in the lower portion of the framework page, you can drill down into different details.

- The **Controls** tab lists all the controls in the framework. You can see your progress on each control and select a control to see details on the checks it maps to.

- The **Policies** tab lists all the policies that contain the checks this framework maps to. You can enable, snooze, and disable policies.

- The **Assets** tab shows the compliance progress of all the assets in the space. You can select an asset to view its details.

- The **Exceptions** tab shows any customization you've created for the framework. To learn more, read [Customize Compliance](/platform/compliance/customize/overview/).

## Generate a compliance report

To provide evidence to auditors, you can generate a report on a space's compliance with an entire framework or an individual control. Mondoo creates reports in PDF format.

3. Select the framework for which you want to create a compliance report.

   If you want to create a report on a single control, select the control in the **Controls** table.

4. To the right of the framework or control title, select the **Generate Report** (download symbol) icon.

6. Select the **VIEW REPORTS** button to go to the Compliance Reports page. It can take some time for Mondoo to generate a PDF with all the requested compliance data. If the new report is still in progress, you can leave and return to the Compliance Reports page later to retrieve it.

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the space for which you want to delete a compliance report.

   ![Space in the Mondoo Console](/img/platform/security/monitor-org.png)
