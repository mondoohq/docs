description: Choose how a Mondoo scores assets based on a policy

Now that you've [explored the very basic elements of a policy and a policy bundle](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/simple/), you can decide how to calculate asset security based on this policy.

Each scanned target receives a graded score that summarizes how well it compares to the checks in the policy:

```text
    80  ..  100   A (100 A+ 95 A 85 A- 80)
    60  ..   79   B ( 79 B+ 75 B 65 B- 60)
    30  ..   59   C ( 59 C+ 50 C 40 C- 30)
    10  ..   29   D ( 29 D+ 25 D 15 D- 10)
     0  ..    9   F
```

The score is based on the number of checks that return a `true` value (pass) compared to how many return a `false` value (fail).

When assessing the overall security of an asset, some checks may be more important than others. For example, suppose a strong cipher is more important to your organization than SSH using port 22. You can use the `impact` attribute to give more importance to one check and less importance to another check. The `Ensure the port is set to 22` check has an impact of `30` (on line 18) and the `Prevent weaker CBC ciphers from being used` check has an impact of `60` (on line 23):

```yaml showLineNumbers
policies:
  - uid: simple-example1
    name: Simple example policy 1
    version: "1.0.0"
    scoring_system: highest impact

    groups:

        checks:
          - uid: sshd-01
            title: Ensure the port is set to 22
            mql: sshd.config.params["Port"] == 22
            impact: 30

          - uid: sshd-02
            title: Prevent weaker CBC ciphers from being used
            mql: sshd.config.ciphers.none( /cbc/ )
            impact: 60

        queries:
          - uid: sshd-d-1
            title: Gather SSH config params
            mql: sshd.config.params
```

How Mondoo uses these values to calculate an asset's score depends on the `scoring_system` setting (line 5). You can choose the `average` scoring system or the `highest impact` scoring system.

:::note Experimental scoring systems

We created two new scoring systems to better reflect an asset's security evaluation. They're currently in the experimental phase:

- Specify `banded` to test our banded scoring system.

- Specify `decayed` to test our decayed scoring system.

To learn about how these systems calculate scores, read the [GitHub PR](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec/pull/1150).

We're grateful for feedback while we refine these systems. To learn more or tell us what you think, join our community discussion on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/mondoohq/discussions">GitHub</a>.

#### Average scoring system

The `average` scoring system considers impact before averaging check scores. Failed checks with higher impact _lower_ an overall score _more_ than checks with lower impact. This is how the `average` scoring system calculates the overall score:

- If a check passes (returns `true`), the asset receives a 100 for that check.

- If a check fails (returns `false`), the asset receives (100-impact) for that check. For example, if an asset fails a check with an impact of 10, it receives a 90 for that check.

Here are possible results of our simple example query, which has a port check and a cipher check:

| Port (impact 30)     | Cipher (impact 60)   | Overall score                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Pass (100)           | Pass (100)           | (100 + 100) / 2 = **100** or **A+** |
| Pass (100)           | Fail (100 - 60 = 40) | (100 + 40) / 2 = **70** or **B**    |
| Fail (100 - 30 = 70) | Pass (100)           | (100 + 70) / 2 = **85** or **A**    |
| Fail (100 - 30 = 70) | Fail (100 - 60 = 40) | (70 + 40) / 2 = **55** or **C**     |

To use the average scoring system, set the `scoring system` value to `average`:

```yaml
policies:
  - uid: simple-example1
    name: Simple example policy 1
    version: "1.0.0"
    scoring_system: average
```

#### Highest (failed) impact scoring system

The `highest impact` scoring system only considers the highest impact check in the policy. It relies on the same method of subtraction as the `average` scoring system: It subtracts the `impact` value from 100 if a check fails. However, unlike the `average` scoring system, it doesn't average all the check scores to calculate the overall score. Instead, it just takes the score of the highest-impact **failed** check and makes that the overall score.

Here are possible results of our simple example query, which has a port check and a cipher check:

| Port (impact 30)      | Cipher (impact 60)    | Overall score     |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| True (100)            | True (100)            | **100** or **A+** |
| True (100)            | False (100 - 60 = 40) | **40** or **C**   |
| False (100 - 30 = 70) | True (100)            | **70** or **B**   |
| False (100 - 30 = 70) | False (100 - 60 = 40) | **40** or **C**   |

To use the highest impact scoring system, set the `scoring system` value to `highest impact`:

```yaml
policies:
  - uid: simple-example1
    name: Simple example policy 1
    version: "1.0.0"
    scoring_system: highest impact
```
