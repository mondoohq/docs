Navigate the [Mondoo Console](/platform/start/navigate) to view and manage different [spaces](/platform/start/organize/spaces) and configurations for your infrastructure security.

Access the Mondoo Console in your web browser at [https://console.mondoo.com](https://console.mondoo.com).

:::tip

The sun/moon icon on the toolbar lets you switch the console display between light and dark display. The Mondoo Console also has a colorblind display option. To learn more, read [Enable Colorblind Mode in the Mondoo Console](/platform/maintain/user/colorblind/).

## Navigate regions, organizations, and spaces

![Mondoo Console top navigation menu](/img/platform/start/nav-top.png)

The assets in your infrastructure are [organized](/platform/start/organize/overview) into [regions](/platform/start/organize/regions), [organizations](/platform/start/organize/organizations), and [spaces](/platform/start/organize/spaces). You move between regions, organizations, and spaces, by selecting the top navigation menu (shown above) and the boxes that represent organizations or spaces.

For example, the image below shows all organizations in the US region. Select an organization to explore and manage it:

:::note

If you have privately hosted Enterprise account, you do not select a region.

:::

In this example, if you select the Lunalectric organization and then select Spaces in the side navigation bar, you see all spaces in the Lunalectric organization.

![Mondoo Console spaces](/img/platform/security/spaces.png)

From there you can select any space to access and manage its details. For example, select the Online Store box to view the Online Store space.

You can filter spaces to see a subset of spaces or find a specific one. Type in the **Filter Spaces** box to see only spaces with names that match what you type. The filter is case sensitive and includes partial matches.

## Perform tasks within a space

The side navigation bar in the Mondoo Console gives you access to tasks you can perform for the current space.
