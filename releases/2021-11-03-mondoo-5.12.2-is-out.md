### üéâ NEW FEATURES

**TLS resource**

We are releasing a new resource that allows you to test remote TLS and SSL
connections.

This resource is currently in preview and may be adjusted or expanded in the
next month.

Whenever you run the `tls` resource against a target, we will execute
a range of tests with the endpoint to see which features it can support:

```javascript
tls("mondoo.com") {
  versions
  ciphers
}
```

```javascript
tls: {
  versions: [
    0: "tls1.3"
    1: "tls1.2"
  ]
  ciphers: [
    0: "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305"
    1: "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
    2: "TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"
    3: "TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256"
    4: "TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"
    5: "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
    6: "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"
    7: "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256"
    8: "TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
  ]
}
```

Additionally, you can gain access to certificates available on the TLS/SSL
endpoint, including the entire certificate chain:

```javascript
tls("mondoo.com").certificates {
  subject.dn
  issuer.dn
}
```

```javascript
tls.certificates: [
  0: {
    subject.dn: "CN=*.edge.easyredir.net"
    issuer.dn: "CN=Sectigo RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA,O=Sectigo Limited,L=Salford,ST=Greater Manchester,C=GB"
  }
  1: {
    subject.dn: "CN=Sectigo RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA,O=Sectigo Limited,L=Salford,ST=Greater Manchester,C=GB"
    issuer.dn: "CN=USERTrust RSA Certification Authority,O=The USERTRUST Network,L=Jersey City,ST=New Jersey,C=US"
  }
  2: {
    subject.dn: "CN=USERTrust RSA Certification Authority,O=The USERTRUST Network,L=Jersey City,ST=New Jersey,C=US"
    issuer.dn: "CN=AAA Certificate Services,O=Comodo CA Limited,L=Salford,ST=Greater Manchester,C=GB"
  }
]
```

**Port resources**

We are also releasing a new resource to allow users to query open ports on their
systems. This resource is currently in preview and may be expanded and adjusted
in the next month.

```javascript
ports.list {
  state
  port
  protocol
  process.executable
  user
}
```

```javascript
ports.list: [
  0: {
    state: "established"
    user: user id = user/1000/zero
    port: 41260
    protocol: "tcp"
    process.executable: "GeckoMain"
  }
  1: {
    state: "established"
    user: user id = user/1000/zero
    port: 51690
    protocol: "tcp"
    process.executable: "GeckoMain"
  }
  ...
```

You can simply query listening ports via:

```javascript
ports.listening {
  port
  protocol
  address
  user
}
```

```javascript
ports.listening: [
  0: {
    protocol: "tcp"
    port: 22
    user: user id = user/0/root
    address: "0.0.0.0"
  }
  1: {
    protocol: "tcp"
    port: 443
    user: user id = user/1000/zero
    address: "127.0.0.1"
  }
  ...
```

**Empty fields in MQL resources**

Problem: Some resources may have fields that don't have values. So far, this
created a challenge in MQL in cases where we couldn't create the resource if
its dependencies were `null`. For example: If we wanted to show a `port` resource
but didn't know its running `process`.

Solution: Allow resources to be initialized with `null` fields.
When extracting values from it, it will render the entire resource as `null` instead
of printing errors for individual fields:

```javascript
ports.list {
  port
  process {
    executable
    pid
  }
}
```

Results in:

```javascript
ports.list: [
  0: {
    port: 34454
    process: {
      pid: 1121
      executable: "GeckoMain"
    }
  }
  1: {
    port: 68
    process: null
  }
  ...
]
```

This is in line with the expected behavior in GraphQL.

**Comments in MQL**

Problem: MQL is oriented around providing querying capabilities found in GraphQL
with scripting found in other lightweight languages like JavaScript. The latter
had informed our commenting style in MQL, which was limited to `//`.
This created problems where users would try comments via `#` resulting in broken queries.

Solution: After careful review we decided to switch comments to use `#` as
the preferred commenting style. This both aligns with comments in YAML, thus
making policy editing easier, and with GraphQL comments.

At the same time we still support and will continue to support comments via
`//`. These are not recommended and may be auto-formatted in the future, but
are available as well.

```javascript
mondoo {
  # This is the recommended commenting style ü§©
  version build
}
```

**Shell commands**

Problem: When using the shell users would try to hit `CTRL + C` to clear
the line but instead exited the shell. This was unexpected to most as most
CLI shells behave differently.

Solution: The Mondoo shell now doesn't exit when you hit `CTRL + C` anymore.
Instead it prints a newline. Additionally, `CTRL + D` now exits the shell,
alongside the already existing `exit` command. This is in line with most
other shell environments we tested.

Additionally you can now hit `CTRL + Z` to pause the execution and send the
Mondoo shell to the background. Like other Linux/macOS/Unix commands, you can
restore it using `fg` in Bash/Zsh/etc.

### üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

- Add basic support for SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro
- AWS Lambda function is now scheduled to update once every 8 hours instead of hourly
- Ô∏èUse connection hostname as vSphere API hostname so users can distinguish them
- Agents can now report more error messages to the server, which will ease
  debugging in the future

### üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- `regex.email` has been improved to more accurately capture email addresses
