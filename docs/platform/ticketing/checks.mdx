Use Mondoo ticketing to track the work of fixing failed checks in your existing workflow. When a Mondoo space has the [ticketing feature configured](/platform/ticketing/overview/), any team member can create a ticket from an advisory. Creating a ticket can either:

- Directly create a new a Jira issue, GitHub issue, GitLab issue, or Zendesk ticket

- Send an email message to the recipient of your choice, such as a listener for your external issue tracking, ticketing, or project management software

For an overview of ticketing, read [Track and Fix Findings with Ticketing](/platform/ticketing/overview/).

import Partial from "../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to a space that is set up to use ticketing.

   :::tip

   You can also select a [workspace](/platform/start/organize/workspaces/) to view a subset of assets within a space.

   :::

2. In the side navigation bar, under **Findings**, select **Checks**.

3. Select the check you want to track using a Mondoo ticket and a corresponding issue in your external tracking system.

4. To the right of the check name, select the **CREATE TICKET** button and select **Selected Assets** to jump to the bottom of the page and see all assets affected by the advisory. (You can also select **All Assets** to create a ticket for all assets affected by the advisory.)

5. Check the boxes beside all the assets for which you want to track this advisory. Note that this creates a single Mondoo ticket (and therefore a single ticket in your external tracking system) for all the assets you choose. (If you want to track assets separately, create a new ticket for each asset.)

   Select the **CREATE TICKET** button.

6. Define the ticket:
   - In the **Integration** box, specify where you want Mondoo to add or send the ticket information.
   - Choose the external destination for the ticket, such as the project, email recipient, or (for GitHub and GitLab) your organization (or user ID) and repository.
   - If you want, change the **Summary** (title) and add your own notes in the **Additional comments** box.
   - If you're creating a Zendesk ticket, set the **Priority** and **Type** of ticket.

7. Select the **CREATE TICKET** button.

   Mondoo creates a new ticket in the space and then either creates a corresponding issue or ticket in your external ticket system or sends email to the selected recipient.
