## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Explore Asset Relationships

**Problem:** Your environment is complex, and so is the job of securing it. You want to understand not just the security of a single asset, but how each asset relates to your overall infrastructure security.

**Solution:** Mondoo now exposes the complex relationships that make up your infrastructure security in a new Explorer tab for each asset. The Explorer view lets you quickly evaluate the security of related assets so you can better understand the security of complex infrastructure like cloud accounts or Kubernetes clusters. Each related asset is shown as a color-coded tile, which you can hover over for additional scan information. Here we see the results of Kubernetes job scans, including a Mondoo Operator job, which scored an A:

### Bundesamt f√ºr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) Windows Policy

**Problem:** You want to secure your Windows systems according to the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and pass a BSI audit.

**Solution:** Mondoo now includes a new `BSI SYS.1.2 Windows Server 2016/2019/2022` policy. BSI is a German standard for IT security, similar to SOC 2 in the US. This new policy complements our existing `BSI SYS.1.3 Linux and Unix Servers` policy for Debian- and Red Hat-based Linux systems. These policies are especially helpful for users in the DACH region and Germany in particular.

### Automatic Cleanup of Kubernetes Resources

**Problem:** Resources come and resources go, but they sure add up quickly. Kubernetes clusters often contain large numbers of ephemeral resources, and over time Mondoo's scanning of resources results in spaces full of long-dead assets.

**Solution:**

Mondoo now automatically cleans up Kubernetes assets older than 24 hours, keeping your spaces tidy and full of relevant scans.

### New `k8s.admissionreview` and `k8s.admissionrequest` Resources

**Problem:** You want to write policies against incoming Kubernetes deployments to understand the security of the deployment request itself.

**Solution:** Mondoo now includes new `k8s.admissionreview` and `k8s.admissionrequest` resources that allow you to write policies against incoming deployments. Stay tuned as we expand this functionality over time to allow additional control over the workloads that make it into your cluster.

### New `k8s.kubelet` Resource

**Problem:** You need to secure your Kubernetes cluster nodes to secure your infrastructure, but the Kubelet configuration system is complex. How do you handle the different names for the same configs and different defaults depending on the config location? Should you check the CLI flags, the YAML config, or the JSON config?

**Solution:** We've abstracted the complexity of parsing the Kubelet config options into a new `k8s.kubelet` resource. The resource parses all three configuration locations, handles defaults, and understands the changing default values when config files are loaded. With this resource, you can write simple queries to check for Kubelet config options and let Mondoo handle the heavy lifting of parsing Kubernetes configuration logic.

A manual query that does not account for default values:

```coffeescript
if (props.kubeletconfigpath != null) {
    cfg = parse.yaml(props.kubeletconfigpath).params
    cfg["featureGates"]["RotateKubeletServerCertificate"] != null
    cfg["featureGates"]["RotateKubeletServerCertificate"] == true
} else {
    processes.where( executable.contains("kubelet")).all(flags["feature-gates"] == "RotateKubeletServerCertificate=true")
}
```

An updated query that includes default value evaluation:

```coffeescript
k8s.kubelet.configuration["featureGates"]["RotateKubeletServerCertificate"] == true
```

We've also updated our existing Kubernetes policies to use this new resource. This dramatically improves the reliability of configuration parsing in these policies, removing potential false positives.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### env and envFrom in Kubernetes Container Resources

**Problem:** You want to write policies to ensure that only secure environment variables are passed into your Kubernetes workloads.

**Solution:** Container resources now expose the `env` and `envFrom` configs. This allows you to inspect manifests with plain text secrets being passed in via env vars like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: luna-frontend
  namespace: prod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: luna-frontend
      image: lunalectric/frontend:1.0
      env:
        - name: LOGIN
          value: "oh_no"
        - name: PASSWORD
          value: "they_are_really_doing_this!"
```

Using a query to check for env var names:

```coffeescript
k8s.pods.all(
  containers.all(
     env["LOGIN"] == null && env["PASSWORD"] == null
  )
)
```

### Expanded Kubernetes Security & Best Practices Policies

We continue to expand our Kubernetes Security Benchmark policy to better secure workloads in your clusters. This week we added two new controls:

- `Pods should mount any host path volumes as read-only`: Ensures that pods don't have write access to paths on the cluster node, which would allow modifying the host configuration.
- `Pods should not bind to a host port`: Ensures pods aren't binding directly to cluster nodes where they can bypass network controls.

### `mondoo exec` Is Now `mondoo run`

We've updated the `mondoo exec` command to be `mondoo run`. The existing command will still work, but help will show just `mondoo run`. We're making this change to align CLI options for some exciting new releases coming soon. Stay tuned for more updates!

## üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- GitHub, Terraform, and cloud Kubernetes policies in the Policy Hub now include custom icons.
- Updates `Pods should not run with NET_RAW capability` and `Pods should not run with SYS_ADMIN capability` controls in the Mondoo Kubernetes Security policy to not fail when no `securityContext` or `capabilities` are defined.
- Resolves failures in `Minimize the admission of root containers` and `Minimize the admission of containers with the NET_RAW capability` controls in CIS Kubernetes policies.
- Asset view once again includes the state of the asset's Mondoo Client.
- Long policy names now truncate better in the asset view.
- The `--option` command line flag is now properly passed through to AWS EBS-based scans.
- The `--token` command line flag is now properly set when scanning GitHub organizations or repositories.
- Scans in the CI/CD view no longer appear unscored.
- Kubernetes cluster nodes are no longer part of the `k8s-workload` family.
- Prevents failures checking kernel parameters if files in `/proc/sys` cannot be read.
