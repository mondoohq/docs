Managing cases includes:

- Viewing open and closed cases

- Examining case details and progress

- Closing cases

- Changing settings that control how cases work in a space

### View cases

On the Cases page in the Mondoo Console, you can view all the open and closed cases in a space and see the progress made toward fixing the assets they track. To view cases in a space:

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to the space.

2. In the side navigation bar, select **Cases**.

   Status bars show progress made by fixing the assets tracked in each case.

3. Select a case to see its details.

:::note

Changes you make to a Mondoo-case-based ticket in your ticket system do not affect the case in Mondoo. Similarly, making progress on a case in Mondoo doesn't update the corresponding ticket in your ticket system.

## Close a case

Close a case to indicate that the work is completed or to stop tracking it. You can close a case from the list of cases or from the case detail page.

import Partial from "../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to the space.

2. In the side navigation bar, select **Cases**.

   Status bars show progress made by fixing the assets tracked in each case.

3. To close the case, either:

   - Select the **CLOSE CASE** button on the row of the case you want to close

   ![Close a case in Mondoo from the open cases list](/img/platform/cases/cases-list-close.png)

   or

   - select the case you want to close and then select the **CLOSE CASE** button near the top-right corner of the case detail page.

:::note

Closing an ticket or issue in your ticket system or does not close the corresponding case in Mondoo. If you create cases using a direct integration with your ticket system, a space-wide setting controls whether closing a case in Mondoo automatically closes the corresponding issue/ticket in your ticket system. To learn more, read the section below.

## Set options for automatically creating cases on drift

Drift occurs when, instead of improving security, an asset becomes _more_ vulnerable to attack:

- An asset previously passed a check in a policy but is now failing that check

- Mondoo previously did not detect a vulnerability on an asset, but now does detect that vulnerability

It's important to catch drift quickly. Mondoo makes that possible with the automatic drift detection option. When an asset becomes less secure, Mondoo can automatically create a case to alert you of the change and track the work on resolving the problem. Like all cases, Mondoo shares automatically created drift cases with your ticket system.

DEETS ABOUT THE SETTING AND SCREENSHOT

## Choose whether to closes tickets/issues when you close cases

![Space-wide cases settings](/img/platform/cases/space-settings.png)

You can choose whether to close the corresponding issue or ticket in your ticket system when you close a case in the Mondoo Console. This setting applies only to direct integrations, not to email integrations.

1. Navigate to the space where you want to change the closing behavior.

2. In the navigation sidebar, select **Settings**.

3. Enable or disable **Automatically close tickets**.
