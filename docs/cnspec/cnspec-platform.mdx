cnspec is now registered with Mondoo Platform. The next time you scan your infrastructure with cnspec, you can see the results in the Mondoo console.

To learn about working in the Mondoo console, see the [Mondoo Platform documentation](/platform/home/).

## Specify a proxy server for communication with Mondoo

You can specify a proxy server for communication between cnspec and Mondoo Platform. This is useful if your default system proxy restricts communication, or if you need to monitor different types of traffic.

1. Find the Mondoo configuration file: `/etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml`.

2. Add this line to `mondoo.yml`:

   ```yaml
   api_proxy: https://1.1.1.1:8080
   ```
