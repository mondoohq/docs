## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Track and remediate vulnerabilities with cases

Cases are a new feature of Mondoo that allow you to turn security findings into tasks to complete. They integrate with Atlassian Jira to fit into your existing workflow.

![Mondoo Case Management Screen](/img/releases/2024-07-09-mondoo-11.12-is-out/screenshot_cases.png)

When you see a security finding that requires fixing, you create a case for that finding. Mondoo automatically includes the details of the finding, information on the asset(s) that contain the finding, and instructions for fixing it. When you save the case, Mondoo automatically creates an issue containing all the same information in your Jira project.

The Jira issues that Mondoo creates from cases include all the details necessary for infrastructure owners to remediate findings, even if they don't have access to Mondoo.

In the Mondoo Console, if a security finding or an asset has a case associated with it, you can view the case from the finding or the asset. You can also see a list of all cases in a space.

You can also close cases in the Mondoo Console and (optionally) also automatically close the corresponding issue in Jira.

Open the [cases management page](https://console.mondoo.com/space/cases) in the Mondoo Console to get started, or [check out the documentation](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/ticketing/overview/).

### Manage compliance frameworks in the CLI

Whether you're iterating on a custom compliance framework locally or automating the management of frameworks stored in source control repos, the new `cnspec framework` command makes managing frameworks a breeze. Now you can list, download, upload, and change the state of frameworks entirely on the command line.

```text
Usage:
  cnspec framework [command]

Available Commands:
  active      Change a framework status to active
  download    Download a compliance framework
  list        List available compliance frameworks
  preview     Change a framework status to preview
  upload      Upload a compliance framework

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for framework

Global Flags:
      --api-proxy string   Set proxy for communications with Mondoo API
      --auto-update        Enable automatic provider installation and update (default true)
      --config string      Set config file path (default $HOME/.config/mondoo/mondoo.yml)
      --log-level string   Set log level: error, warn, info, debug, trace (default "info")
  -v, --verbose            Enable verbose output
```
