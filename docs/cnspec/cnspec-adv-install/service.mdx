This document covers how to run cnspec as a service on hosts in your environment.

## Configure cnspec to run as a service

When configured as a service, cnspec continuously assesses hosts by running policies configured in Mondoo Platform. By default, every 60 minutes, cnspec service:

1. Connects to your account in the platform

2. Retrieves and validates the latest policies enabled for it.

3. Scans the host.

4. Reports scan results back to the platform.

import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
defaultValue="linux"
values={[
{ label: 'Linux', value: 'linux', },
{ label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', },
{ label: 'macOS', value: 'mac', },
]
}>
<TabItem value="linux">

The installation places a systemd unit file at `/etc/systemd/system/cnspec.service`. However, it does not register or enable the service.

:::info

Before starting cnspec as a service, you should have already [registered the host](./registration.md) with your Mondoo Platform account.

:::

#### Enable and start cnspec as a service

```bash title="1. Reload systemd daemon and load the cnspec.service unit file"
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

```bash title="2. Enable cnspec to run during startup"
sudo systemctl enable cnspec
```

```bash title="3. Start cnspec service"
sudo systemctl start cnspec
```

```bash title="4. Check the status of cnspec"
sudo systemctl status cnspec
```

#### cnspec service logging

cnspec service writes log events to the system logs. You can use this command to tail cnspec service logs on Linux hosts:

```bash title="Tail cnspec service logs"
sudo journalctl -u cnspec -f
```

The default log level is `info` but can be configured as defined in [cnspec Configuration options](#cnspec-configuration-options) below

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

When installed on Windows, the mondoo package automatically registers with the Service Control Manager in Windows, but sets the default **Startup Type** to **Manual** and does not start the service.

#### Running as a service

Launch a PowerShell terminal as an administrator and run these commands:

:::info

Before starting cnspec as a service, you should have already [registered the host](./registration.md) with your Mondoo Platform account.

:::

```powershell title="1. Set mondoo service to run automatically at startup"
Set-Service -Name mondoo -StartupType Automatic
```

```powershell title="2. Start mondoo service"
Set-Service -Name mondoo -Status Running
```

```powershell title="3. Validate mondoo is running as a service"
Get-Service mondoo | Select-Object -Property Name, StartType, Status
```

#### Mondoo service logging

Mondoo service writes logging events to the Windows Event Viewer Application logs. To view logs:

![](/img/platform/installation/windows-event-viewer.png)

1. Select the **Start Menu** and launch **Event Viewer**
2. Expand **Windows Logs**
3. Select **Application** to view application logs
4. Use **Find...** to search for "cnspec"

<TabItem value="mac">
If you installed cnspec using the PKG installer, a launchd service is created automatically. If you installed cnspec using Homebrew, you can manually create the service plist file at /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mondoo.client.plist:

```xml title="Create the com.mondoo.client.plist file"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>Label</key>
	<string>com.mondoo.client</string>
	<key>ProgramArguments</key>
	<array>
		<string>/path/to/cnspec</string>
		<string>serve</string>
		<string>-t</string>
		<string>60</string>
		<string>--config</string>
		<string>/etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml</string>
	</array>
	<key>RunAtLoad</key>
	<true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

You must replace "/path/to/cnspec" with the path to cnspec on your host. You can validate this by opening a terminal and running `which cnspec`. Also, ensure you specify the correct path to Mondoo Platform config ("/etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml" in the example above), which can be validated by opening a terminal and running `cnspec status`. Additionally, you can adjust the scan frequency (60 minutes by default).

```bash title="Load the Launchd Service"
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mondoo.client.plist
```

To start, stop or check the status of the service, use the _launchctl_ tool:

```bash
$ sudo launchctl start com.mondoo.client
$ sudo launchctl list | grep cnspec
-	1	com.mondoo.client
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## cnspec serve

In addition to leveraging the platform service management system, cnspec includes the `cnspec serve` command, which you can use on any supported platform (Linux, Windows, macOS) to continuously run assessments of hosts.

:::info

cnspec serve leverages the default configuration of the host if already [registered](./registration.md).

:::

### Set a custom scan interval

Use the `--timer` flag to set a scan interval in minutes. The default is 60. For example, this runs a scan with `cnspec serve` every 15 minutes:

```bash
cnspec serve --timer 15
```

## cnspec configuration options

cnspec configuration is stored on the host at this location:

- **Linux** - `/etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml`
- **Windows** - `C:\ProgramData\Mondoo\mondoo.yml`

Common cnspec service configuration options:

| Name           | Description                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent_mrn`    | Agent Mondoo resource name, identifies the client                           |
| `api_endpoint` | The URL of Mondoo Platform (`https://us.api.mondoo.com` is the default)     |
| `certificate`  | Client's public certificate                                                 |
| `loglevel`     | Service log level: error, warn, info, debug, trace (default is info)        |
| `mrn`          | Service Account Mondoo resource name, which identifies the service account  |
| `private_key`  | Client's private key used to sign requests sent to Mondoo Platform          |
| `space_mrn`    | Space Mondoo resource name, identifies the space that the client belongs to |
| `annotations`  | Annotations that display in the Mondoo Console `condole.mondoo.com`         |

```yaml title="mondoo.yml"

## cnspec inventory

cnspec inventory configuration defines a list of targets for cnspec to scan. This example contains an ssh-based scan with annotations:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: cnspec-ssh-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    # linux with password authentication
    - id: linux-ssh-with-password
      connections:
        - host: 192.168.5.89
          type: ssh
          credentials:
            - type: password
              user: mondoo
              password: mondoo
      annotations:
        key: value
```

This example scans the local machine and all running containers:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - id: docker-container
      connections:
        - type: local
          discover:
            targets:
              - "container"
```

This example scans the local machine and all container images:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - id: docker-container
      connections:
        - type: local
          discover:
            targets:
              - "container-images"
```

This example scans the vSphere environment with embedded credentials:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - name: vsphere
      connections:
        - type: vsphere
          host: 192.168.5.24
          credentials:
            - type: password
              user: mondoo-read@vsphere.local
              password: test
          discover:
            targets:
              - host-machines
```

This example scans the vSphere environment with extracted credentials and reference:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - name: vsphere
      connections:
        - type: vsphere
          host: 192.168.5.24
          credentials:
            - secret_id: my-secret
          discover:
            targets:
              - host-machines
  credentials:
    my-secret:
      type: password
      user: mondoo-read@vsphere.local
      password: test
```

This example scans the vSphere environment with credentials from HashiCorp Vault:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - name:
      connections:
        - type: vsphere
          host: 192.168.5.24
          insecure: true
          credentials:
            - secret_id: vcenter/mondoo-read
          discover:
            targets:
              - auto
      annotations:
        Owner: patrick@mondoo.com
  vault:
    name: cnspec-hashivault
    type: hashicorp-vault
    options:
      url: http://127.0.0.1:8200
      token: XXXXXXXX
```

Example to scan a Microsoft 365 account:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - connections:
        - type: ms365
          credentials:
            - type: pkcs12
              private_key_path: "/Users/atomic111/Projects/presales/m365-scanning/certificate.combo.pem"
          options:
            client-id: c4b89770-5ed2-4367-b4f6-ff05ffcb3406
            organization: ""
            sharepoint-url: ""
            tenant-id: d9abc6fc-fd88-4480-a931-2f7939adbac2
          discover:
            targets:
              - auto
```

Example to scan an Azure tenant including all subscriptions:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - connections:
        - type: azure
          credentials:
            - type: pkcs12
              private_key_path: "</Users/user/tmpjddt4b_y5.pem>"
          options:
            client-id: 9f51cb-66c3-4gg9-b525-fbd717384d96
            lun: "0"
            tenant-id: f115cf8c-a2d4-51ef-1234-56f7ed7e18ec
          discover:
            targets:
              - auto
```

Example to scan a Google Workspace account:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - connections:
        - type: google-workspace
          credentials:
            - type: json
              secret: <base64 encoded secret>
          options:
            customer-id: D34dr1r
            impersonated-user-email: user@lunalectric.com
```

To execute cnspec with the inventory file, run this command:

```bash
cnquery scan --inventory-file ./inventory.yml
```

## cnspec inventory template

cnspec inventory files are useful for a CI/CD pipeline. Inventory templates are useful for scanning different assets for different environments. They allow you to reuse the same template with a custom variable. This example uses the `getenv` function to include an environment variable (the asset name):

```yaml
spec:
  assets:
    - name: {{ getenv "ASSET_NAME" }}
      connections:
        - type: local
          discover:
            targets:
              - auto
```

You can use this example inventory template by providing the `ASSET_NAME` and variable with the `cnspec scan` command and specifying the template:

```bash
ASSET_NAME="my_asset" cnspec scan --inventory-template template.yaml
```
