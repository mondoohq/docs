## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Azure ACR Scanning

Mondoo now supports scanning [Azure Container Registries (ACR)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-registry) that require authentication using credentials stored after running the `az acr login` command.

To login and scan a complete registry run:

```bash
az acr login -n my_registry
cnspec scan container registry my_registry.azurecr.io
```

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Collect logged in users in query packs

Windows, Linux, and macOS query backs now collect the currently logged in users so you can understand active users on endpoints or remote connections to servers.
