## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Fine grained scanning of GitLab assets

Mondoo now offers more detailed scanning capabilities for GitLab assets. Instead of the previous single `gitlab` asset, Mondoo now provides separate `gitlab-group` and `gitlab-project` assets. When scanning your GitLab group, both cnspec and cnquery now automatically detect each project within your group. This enhanced granularity in asset scans improves the accuracy of scan results and allows for setting exceptions for specific projects.

```text
 cnspec scan gitlab --group lunalectric
→ loaded configuration from /Users/luna/.config/mondoo/mondoo.yml using source default
→ using service account credentials
→ discover related assets for 1 asset(s)
→ resolved assets resolved-assets=37
→ synchronize assets
 lunalectric / rockets_101         ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100%
 lunalectric / oxygen_generator    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100%
 lunalectric / space_cats          ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100%
 lunalectric / rover_design        ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100%
 lunalectric / human_habitats      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100%

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Runtime data in AWS Lambda function resource

The `aws.lambda.function` MQL resource now includes a new `runtime` field that displays the runtime environment of the function. Thanks for this addition [@mbainter](https://github.com/mbainter)!

## 🐛 BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Fix a panic viewing some asset data in the asset resources tab.
- Add more user-friendly control titles to the SOC 2 compliance framework.
- Show 0% check completion instead of “Unknown” when appropriate in compliance controls.
- Automatically close the search box when results display.
- Fix hardware systems incorrectly identifying as Azure VMs in asset configuration data.
- Improve reliability of the CIS `Ensure GDM login banner is configured` check on RHEL based systems.
- Prevent errors in the CIS `Ensure filesystem integrity is regularly checked` check when the `aide` package is not installed.
