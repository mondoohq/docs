Software vendors often release _advisories_ that provide recommendations on how to fix or mitigate vulnerabilities in their products. Advisories may or may not be released before vulnerabilities are disclosed. Sometimes advisories provide workarounds or other steps that users can take to mitigate a security weakness in the vendorâ€™s products.

:::note

Not every known software issue has an advisory. Be sure to monitor vulnerabilities (CVEs) to find potential exploits in your infrastructure. To learn more, read [Find Vulnerabilities](/platform/security/posture/vulnerabilities).

## Find advisories in your infrastructure

Find advisories for assets in a space:

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate to the space](/platform/start/navigate) in which you want to see advisories.

2. In the left navigation bar, under **Vulnerabilities**, select **Advisories**.

   ![Find Advisories](/img/platform/security/advisories.png)

   The list shows CVEs found in your infrastructure. For each CVE, Mondoo shows a rank (priority compared to other CVEs), score (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, OR LOW), blast radius (calculated based on the affected assets), any [risk factors](#risk-factors), and when the vulnerability was first found in your infrastructure.

   To learn how Mondoo calculates risk and rank, read [Security Findings](/platform/security/posture/findings/).

3. To filter the list, enter text in the search bar. These are some examples:

   - To show only advisories for a certain platform, enter all or part of the platform name. For example, type `windows`, `debian`, or `google`.

   - To find an advisory related to a specific CVE number, enter all or part of the number. For example, type `2024-21755` or `1325`.

   - To find advisories for a certain service, tool, API, or other technology, enter all or part of its name. For example, enter `winsock`, `curl`, or `cim`.

4. To see the assets in your space where the advisory is found, select the advisory.

## Risk factors

Risk factors are attributes that can elevate the risk that an advisory poses to your organization. Advisories can have their own risk factors:

| Icon                                                             | Risk factor                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Exploitable icon](/img/platform/security/exploitable.svg)      | **Exploitable** advisories have known exploits in the wild. Attackers know how to breach a system using this defect and have already shown it can be done. |
| ![Remote execution icon](/img/platform/security/remote-exec.svg) | **Remote execution** advisories are known to present remote code execution over the network. They let an attacker run malicious code on a target system.   |

Mondoo also flags an advisory if the _assets_ that contain the advisory have factors that increase or decrease risk. These are _contextual_ risk factors for an advisory:

| Icon                                                    | Risk factor                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Keys icon](/img/platform/security/keys.svg)           | **Accessible keys** indicates that key or credential information is exposed on at least one asset with this advisory.                                                                                           |
| ![EOL icon](/img/platform/security/eol.svg)             | **End-of-life (EOL)** indicates that at least one asset with this advisory is running an operating system version that is approaching or has reached EOL (no longer supported).                                 |
| ![Database icon](/img/platform/security/db.svg)         | **Database** indicates that at least one asset with this advisory hosts a running database (MySQL or PostgreSQL).                                                                                               |
| ![In use icon](/img/platform/security/use.svg)          | **In use** indicates that at least one asset with this advisory has a running service or is in active use. Examples are assets running sshd, OpenSSH, NGINX, or Apache, or assets with open or listening ports. |
| ![Defensive icon](/img/platform/security/defensive.svg) | **Defensive** indicates that at least one asset with this advisory has defensive countermeasures in place (SELinux or AppArmor).                                                                                |
