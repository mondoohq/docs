Mondoo can provide a thorough and detailed inventory of your entire infrastructure. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), you can explore all the assets registered with your account and investigate configuration details.

Mondoo's inventory lets you drill down into an asset's configuration to learn details about that asset.

## Enable an inventory

To view an inventory of a space, you must first enable the inventories you want to see for the space. For example, if you want to inventory your AWS infrastructure, you must enable the AWS inventory for the space you want to see. You manage inventories in the registry.

import Partial from "../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), use the top navigation bar to choose the space you want to inventory.

2. In the left navigation menu, select **Registry**.

3. Under **REGISTRY**, select **Query Packs**.

4. In the **Filter** search box, type `inventory`.

   The registry shows only inventories. The toggles for enabled inventories are purple. The toggles for disabled inventories are white and gray.

5. Select the toggle beside an inventory to enable it.

Mondoo inventories the applicable assets registered to the space.

## View asset inventory details in the Inventory view

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), use the [top navigation bar](/platform/start/navigate) to choose the [organization and space](/platform/start/organize/overview/) you want to view.

   The Inventory view displays by default when you access a different organization or space. If you're currently in a different view, use the [left navigation bar](/platform/start/navigate): Select **Inventory**.

2. To drill down into a space, select the box representing the space.

   Mondoo organizes your space by integration type, showing summary scores for each integration. You can select an integration type box to see only that type of asset, or you can select the **INVENTORY** box to access and search all assets in the space.

5. To see the results of all the enabled queries on the asset, select the **Data Queries** tab.
