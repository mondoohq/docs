Mondoo secures the servers and endpoints that are the backbone of your business. Mondoo's cross-platform CLI, [cnspec](/cnspec/cnspec-about/), is a core Mondoo component that finds misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in Linux, macOS, Windows, and AIX assets. You install cnspec on your servers and endpoints and register them with Mondoo so that you can continuously monitor their security.
