Now that you've [explored the very basic elements of a policy and a policy bundle](/cnspec/cnspec-policies/write/simple/), you can decide how to calculate asset security based on this policy.

Each scanned target receives a letter score that summarizes how well it compares to the checks in the policy. Letter scores are based on numeric scores between 0 and 100. These are the ranges for Mondoo letter scores:

| From... | To... | Letter score |
|:-------:|:-----:|:------------:|
| 80      | 100   | A            |
| 60      | 79    | B            |
| 30      | 59    | C            |
| 10      | 29    | D            |
| 0       | 9     | F            |

The score is based on the number of checks that return a `true` value (pass) compared to how many return a `false` value (fail).

When assessing the overall security of an asset, some checks may be more important than others. For example, suppose a strong cipher is more important to your organization than SSH using port 22. You can use the `impact` attribute to give more importance to one check and less importance to another check. The `Ensure the port is set to 22` check has an impact of `90` (on line 18) and the `Prevent weaker CBC ciphers from being used` check has an impact of `80` (on line 23):

```yaml showLineNumbers

            title: Ensure the port is set to 22
            mql: sshd.config.params["Port"] == 22
            impact: 90

          - uid: sshd-02
            title: Prevent weaker CBC ciphers from being used
            mql: sshd.config.ciphers.none( /cbc/ )
            impact: 80

        queries:
          - uid: sshd-d-1
            title: Gather SSH config params
            mql: sshd.config.params
```

How Mondoo uses these values to calculate an asset's score depends on the `scoring_system` setting (line 5). You can choose from these scoring systems:

- Average

- Banded (default)

- Decayed

- Highest (failed) impact

#### Average scoring system

The average scoring system considers impact before averaging check scores. Failed checks with higher impact _lower_ an overall score _more_ than checks with lower impact. This is how the average scoring system calculates the overall score:

- If a check passes (returns `true`), the asset receives a 100 for that check.

- If a check fails (returns `false`), the asset receives (100-impact) for that check. For example, if an asset fails a check with an impact of 90, it receives a 10 for that check.

Here are possible results of our simple example query, which has a port check and a cipher check:

| Port (impact 90)     | Cipher (impact 80)   | Overall score                       |
| :------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Pass (100)           | Pass (100)           | (100 + 100) / 2 = **100** or **A+** |
| Pass (100)           | Fail (100 - 80 = 20) | (100 + 20) / 2 = **60** or **B**    |
| Fail (100 - 90 = 10) | Pass (100)           | (10 + 100) / 2 = **55** or **C**    |
| Fail (100 - 90 = 10) | Fail (100 - 80 = 20) | (10 + 20) / 2 = **15** or **D**     |

To use the average scoring system, set the `scoring system` value to `average`:

```yaml
policies:
  - uid: simple-example1
    name: Simple example policy 1
    version: "1.0.0"
    scoring_system: average
```

#### Banded scoring system (recommended)

The banded scoring system uses the average scoring system as its foundation, but includes factors that keep it from assigning misleadingly high scores.

It follows the average scoring system in these ways:

- It also considers impact before averaging check scores, so that failed checks with higher impact _lower_ an overall score _more_ than checks with lower impact.

- If a check passes (returns `true`), the asset receives a 100 for that check.

- If a check fails (returns `false`), the asset receives (100-impact) for that check. For example, if an asset fails a check with an impact of 10, it receives a 90 for that check.

But the banded scoring system doesn't simply calculate the average of the impact-weighted check scores to produce the asset score. It also applies upper and lower limits to asset scores based on _impact bands_.

Impact bands are ranges of impact scores for checks:

| Band      | From... | To... |
| :-------- | :------ | :---- |
| Critical  | 90      | 100   |
| High      | 70      | 89    |
| Medium    | 40      | 60    |
| Low       | 0       | 39    |

For example, a check with an impact score of 90 is in the critical band, while a check with an impact score of 10 is in the low band.

In the banded scoring system, if an asset fails one or more critical checks, the asset's maximum possible overall score is 50. For example, suppose you scan an asset using a policy with 99 checks with an impact of 70 (high band) and one critical check in the critical band with an impact of 90. If the asset fails the single critical check, its overall score can't be higher than a 50. Even if it passes _all_ the high band checks which, in the average scoring system would give it an overall score of 69 it still gets a 50 because of the single critical failure.

In addition, the banded scoring system:

- Ensures that the score quickly goes down as the number of critical findings increase

- Takes into account other scoring failures (like high and medium)

- Guarantees a minimum score when an asset has no critical or high failures

To use the banded scoring system, set the `scoring system` value to `banded`:

```yaml
policies:
  - uid: simple-example1
    name: Simple example policy 1
    version: "1.0.0"
    scoring_system: banded
```

#### Decayed scoring system

Like the average and banded scoring systems, the decayed scoring system calculates an asset's score based on the impact of the checks that pass and fail. What's unique is that it uses [exponential decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay): As checks fail, this system decreases the score of the asset at a rate proportional to its current value. Compared to the average scoring system, the decayed scoring system:

- Quickly reduces scores as critical findings are added

- Doesn't sink scores to zero too quickly as more checks fail

![Banded scoring system in Mondoo](/img/cnspec/decayed.png)

To use the decayed scoring system, set the `scoring system` value to `decayed`:

```yaml
policies:
  - uid: simple-example1
    name: Simple example policy 1
    version: "1.0.0"
    scoring_system: decayed
```

#### Highest (failed) impact scoring system

The highest impact scoring system only considers the highest impact check in the policy. It relies on the same method of subtraction as the average scoring system: It subtracts the `impact` value from 100 if a check fails. However, unlike the average scoring system, it doesn't average all the check scores to calculate the overall score. Instead, it just takes the score of the highest-impact **failed** check and makes that the overall score.

To use the highest impact scoring system, set the `scoring system` value to `highest impact`:

```yaml
policies:
  - uid: simple-example1
    name: Simple example policy 1
    version: "1.0.0"
    scoring_system: highest impact
```
