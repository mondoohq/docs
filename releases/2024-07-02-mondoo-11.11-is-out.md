## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Continuous GitHub Enterprise scanning

Mondoo's GitHub integration has expanded to support GitHub Enterprise as well. GitHub Enterprise users can now get all the Mondoo GitHub features for their private instances, including scans of their GitHub configuration and automatic discovery of Terraform code and Kubernetes manifests in GitHub repositories.

Check out the documentation to [learn more about integrating Mondoo Platform with GitHub Enterprise](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/infra/saas/github/).

### IaC file discovery in GitHub and GitLab

Mondoo now automatically discovers and scans Terraform code and Kubernetes manifests in GitHub and GitLab. If any static Terraform (HCL) or Kubernetes manifest files exist in a repo, Mondoo can detect and scan them for security misconfigurations. This option lets infrastructure developers responsible for writing and maintaining infrastructure as code detect security issues before they create problems in production.

Configure scanning in your existing GitHub and GitLab integrations.

### NIS2 Cybersecurity Directive compliance framework

Mondoo introduces a new NIS2 compliance framework for companies in the European Union that must comply with the NIS2 cybersecurity directive.

### CIS Google Workspace benchmark policy

Secure your Google Workspace infrastructure with the new CIS Google Workspace Foundations Benchmark Level 1 and 2 policies including 58 important security checks.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Oracle Linux Kernel CVE support

Mondoo now detects and reports vulnerabilities in the Oracle Unbreakable Enterprise Linux Kernel.

### DaemonSet-based Kubernetes integration scanning

The Mondoo Kubernetes integration now supports running as either a DaemonSet, a Deployment or a CronJob, depending on your needs.

### Improved GitHub organization scanning scalability

Multiple improvements to the GitHub organization scanner now better ensure that Mondoo does not accidentally trigger GitHub's API rate limits.

### Improved Mondoo Terraform provider

The Terraform provider for Mondoo has several changes:

- The Terraform provider has full access to the asset list of a Mondoo space and can leverage those assets in Terraform HCL.
- The Terraform provider now has access to the full list of active policies via a data source.
- You can now use Terraform to enable Mondoo compliance frameworks and even upload custom frameworks.
