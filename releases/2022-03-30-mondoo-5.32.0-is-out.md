Mondoo 5.32.0 is out. The Big features this release: A re-designed and improved Policy Hub, full support for AlmaLinux, and a new color scheme for the UI!

## ðŸŽ‰ NEW FEATURES

### **Re-designed Policy Hub**

We've re-designed the Policy Hub with many new features. The Policy Hub now helps you quickly understand much greater nuance about your policies. Policy scores let you see at a glance which policies have the broadest adherence or divergence in your organization. The assets count shows which policies have the widest impact across your fleet of assets. And un-used policies are now hidden by default.

**Asset View**

The individual policy view now has an asset tab. This tab displays the policy score for each asset to which the policy applies.

**Hide un-used policies**

The Policy Hub now only shows policies that have been enabled in the Space.

Previously, the Policy Hub would display all available policies, even if those policies had not been enabled for the Space. To show new policies, use the "Add Policy" button.

### **AlmaLinux Support**

Mondoo now includes support for the latest Red Hat Linux derivative, AlmaLinux. This includes updates to the client install scripts, Chef Infra cookbook support, and new AlmaLinux OS 8 CIS Level 1 and 2 benchmarks.

### **New Colors**

The Mondoo Console has been refreshed with a new color scheme. As a result, text pops and graphs are much easier to differentiate.

### ðŸ§¹ IMPROVEMENTS

**New and Improved Policies**

We've been busy this week expanding and improving our out of the box policies with a number of new early access policies now available:

- New Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Level 1 / 2 CIS benchmarks
- New early access Terraform Static Analysis Policy for AWS EKS policy
- New early access GitLab Baseline by Mondoo
- Updated SLES 12 and 15 CIS benchmarks to version 1.1.1
- Expanded the queries in our RHEL 8 CIS benchmarks
- Improved the Kubernetes Application Benchmark by Mondoo

**Updated Client Install Script**

Our Mondoo Client install.sh script now supports AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, and macOS systems without Homebrew.
