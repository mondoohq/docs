## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### New CI/CD integrations

To help you better visualize scans of CI/CD pipelines, we've added new specialized views to the Mondoo Console. Of course, Mondoo already lets you scan infrastructure artifacts during the build process, such as Kubernetes Manifests, Terraform code, and Docker images. But now, you can use Mondoo to compare different builds and branches and see how they compare to one another.

[Check out the official documentation and get started today!](/platform/infra/supply/cicd/overview/)

### Mondoo is in the GitHub Marketplace

To go with our new GitHub CI/CD views, Mondoo is now available as an action in the GitHub Marketplace. Use Mondoo with GitHub Actions to scan Kubernetes Manifests, Terraform configuration files, and Docker images. See examples and full setup instructions on [our page in the GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/mondoo-action).

### Kubernetes integrations

With the Mondoo Kubernetes Operator, you can now continuously validate your deployed workloads and assess the configuration and security of the nodes running your kubelets. Couple this with the Mondoo Admission Controller and Mondoo's support for scanning Kubernetes Manifests in the CI/CD pipeline. Mondoo provides a complete, end-to-end solution for securing Kubernetes from commit to production.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### New asset page

We've given the individual asset view a beautiful new makeover. Graphs and scorecards help you understand how your assets stack up against policy at a glance, and the integrated filters make it easy to find the most relevant policies.
