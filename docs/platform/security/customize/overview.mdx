To meet your business's unique security needs, you can customize policies:

- [Change the scoring system](/platform/security/customize/score/) that a policy uses.

- [Disable or snooze a check](/platform/security/customize/checks/) in a policy to exclude it from security assessments.

- [Change check properties](/platform/security/customize/checks/) to customize the values that Mondoo scans for.
