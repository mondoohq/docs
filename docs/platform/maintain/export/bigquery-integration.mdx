The Mondoo BigQuery integration lets you continuously export your space data, such as assets and vulnerabilities, to a Google BigQuery dataset. The export runs approximately every 24 hours.

## Requirements

- The GCP IAM API enabled

- The GCP BigQuery API enabled

- The GCP CLI installed

- Editor or Owner access to the space from which you want to export data

## Create a service account for your Google BigQuery integration

To access the data it needs, your BigQuery integration needs a GCP service account. To learn about service accounts, read [Understanding service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) in the Google documentation.

1. Create a new GCP service account for the Mondoo integration to use.

   For instructions, read [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#iam-service-accounts-create-gcloud) in the Google documentation.

   Note the email address created for the new service account.

2. Create a JSON key for the service account.

   For instructions, read [Create and manage service account keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#iam-service-account-keys-get-gcloud) in the Google documentation.

   Save the JSON file that downloads to your workstation when you create the key. You need it to configure the integration (in the next section below).

## Create a BigQuery dataset

Your BigQuery integration needs a GCP BigQuery dataset to which to export data. To learn about BigQuery datasets, read [Introduction to datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets-intro) in the Google documentation.

1. Create a new GCP BigQuery dataset for the Mondoo integration to use.

   For instructions, read [Creating datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets) in the Google documentation.

2. Assign the "BigQuery Data Editor" role to the GCP service account you created in the instructions above.

   For instructions, read [Grant access to a dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/control-access-to-resources-iam#grant_access_to_a_dataset) in the Google documentation.

   For a description of the permissions that the "BigQuery Data Editor" role grants, read [Understanding roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#bigquery-roles) in the Google documentation.

## Add a new BigQuery integration

1. Access the Integrations > Add > BigQuery page in one of two ways:

   - New space setup: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **BigQuery**.

     ![Welcome to Mondoo Page](/img/platform/start/welcome_to_mondoo.png)

   - INTEGRATIONS page: Navigate to **INTEGRATIONS**. Under Exports, select **BigQuery**.

     ![integration-create-image](/img/platform/maintain/export/bigquery/add-int-bigquery-top.png)

2. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that lets you easily recognize the GCP BigQuery dataset.

3. Identify the BigQuery dataset to use for the export.

   In the **Enter the Dataset ID** box, enter your BigQuery dataset's resource ID. To learn how to retrieve this value, read [Listing datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/listing-datasets) in the Google documentation.

4. Under **Provide your Google Service Account config**, upload the GCP service account's JSON key that you downloaded in the previous section:

   Drag the file and drop it in the **Drag and drop your .json file here** box.

   OR

   In the **Drag and drop your .json file here** box, select the cloud icon and choose the file to upload.

5. To complete the integration, select the **CREATE INTEGRATION** button.

   Mondoo begins exporting information from your space. When this initial export completes, the integration status becomes **ACTIVE**. Mondoo performs an export approximately every 24 hours.

## View your BigQuery integration

1. In the side navigation bar, under Integrations, select **BigQuery**.

2. In the list of BigQuery integrations, select the integration you want to view.

### Statuses

The possible statuses for a BigQuery integration are:

- **active**: The integration is active/healthy.
- **error**: Mondoo detected an error during export.

### Export data to BigQuery at any time

Mondoo exports your data to BigQuery approximately every 24 hours. You can also manually export data at any time. Use the **SCHEDULE NOW** button to request an export right away. Mondoo begins the export as soon as possible. If Mondoo is processing a lot of data, there can be some delay until Mondoo has sufficient resources.

### Remove an integration

To remove an integration, select the trash can icon. A confirmation prompt displays. Once you confirm the deletion, Mondoo removes the configured integration and stops triggering exports for the BigQuery dataset.

:::info

Mondoo does not delete your GCP BigQuery dataset or existing exported data. You must delete the dataset manually.
