## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Cases and ticket system integrations!

![Case Overview](/img/releases/2024-09-17-mondoo-11.22-is-out/case_overview.png)

Mondoo users can now group security findings into cases and assign those cases to external ticket systems for efficient tracking and resolution. Cases ship today with out-of-the-box support for Jira and Zendesk, with more to come.

- Delegate cases to external teams using your existing ticketing systems.
- Automatically update issues as your team remediates findings, ensuring real-time progress tracking.
- Auto-close cases and corresponding tickets when all findings within a case are resolved.
