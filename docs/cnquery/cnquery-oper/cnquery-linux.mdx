cnquery provides the answers you need about your Linux assets. For example, you can retrieve the distribution, user information, or security settings.

For a list of Linux resources you can query, read [Mondoo Operating Systems (OS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/os-pack/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core-pack/).

## Requirements

To explore a Linux asset with cnquery, you must have:

- [cnquery installed on your workstation](/cnquery/)
- Access to the asset

## Query a Linux asset

To answer any question about your environment, use cnquery's interactive shell. It has auto-complete to guide you, which is especially helpful when you're new to cnquery and learning MQL.

To launch a shell into your local Linux environment, enter:

```bash
cnquery shell
```

To launch a shell into a remote Linux environment, enter:

```bash
cnquery shell ssh user@HOST
```

For `HOST`, substitute the hostname of the remote Linux asset.

### Discover capabilities with the `help` command

Once inside the shell, use the `help` command to learn what Linux resources you can query. This command lists all the operating system resources:

```coffee
help os
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down further. For example, enter this command to list the OS update information you can retrieve:

```coffee
help os.update
```

You can also learn about available Linux resources in the [Mondoo Operating Systems (OS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/os-pack/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core-pack/).

### Get simple answers in the shell

Now that you know how to discover what's possible with cnquery, let's run some actual queries in the shell.

This query asks the hostname:

```coffee
asset.name
```

cnquery returns the pretty hostname:

```coffee
asset.name: "luna-ubuntu-05"
```

This query asks the name of the operating system:

```coffee
asset.platform
```

### Query users

To request a list of all users on a machine, enter this query in the shell:

```coffee
users
```

### Request full details in results

For a more detailed report, you can specify that you want all fields:

```coffee
users { * }
```

For every user, cnquery provides information about their settings.

### Specify fields to include in results

If you're interested in only some details, specify the fields you want in braces. For example, this query asks for each user's name, group, and whether it's enabled:

```coffee
users { name group enabled }
```

### Filter results

You can filter results based on any fields. Specify the criteria using the `where` function and standard boolean operators.

For example, this filters results based on group name:

```coffee
users.where(group.name == "admins") { name uid }
```

cnquery returns all users in the `admins` group. It includes the name and UID for each user.

## Learn more about querying Linux

- To learn more about how the MQL query language works, read [Write Effective MQL](/mql/mql.write/).
- For a list of all the Linux resources and fields you can query, read the [Mondoo Operating Systems (OS) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/os-pack/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core-pack/).

## Analyze your environment with query packs

Mondoo makes these [core Linux query packs](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery-packs) available in GitHub:

- [Linux Inventory Pack](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery-packs/blob/main/core/mondoo-linux-inventory.mql.yaml) provides information about all your AWS assets and their configuration.
- [Linux Incident Response Pack](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery-packs/blob/main/core/mondoo-linux-incident-response.mql.yaml) helps you investigate and minimize damage when a security incident occurs.

To run one of these purpose-built collections of Linux-specific queries:

1. In Mondoo's [cnquery-packs GitHub repo](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery-packs), go to the `core` directory and find the Linux query pack you want to run.

2. Download the YAML file to a local directory and, in your terminal, move to that directory.

3. Use the `cnquery scan` command, specifying the file and the query pack:

```bash
cnquery scan -f mondoo-linux-incident-response.mql.yaml --querypack mondoo-incident-response-linux
```

You can also create your own query packs to meet your specific needs. To learn more about query packs, read [Run a Query Pack](/cnquery/cnquery-run-pack/).
