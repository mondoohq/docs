### ðŸŽ‰ NEW FEATURES

**CIS Amazon Linux 2 Policy Certification**

This week, the "CIS Amazon Linux 2" policy becomes the 10th addition to Mondoo's suite of CIS-certified policies. We now offer CIS-certified policies for:

- Amazon Linux
- AWS
- CentOS
- Debian
- macOS
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 6, 7, and 8
- Windows 2019
- And more!

There are more CIS-certified policies on the way. Evaluate your assets against these policies and many more, free from the Policy Hub.

**Kubernetes Operator is available**

We're excited to announce Early Access to our [Mondoo Operator for Kubernetes](https://github.com/mondoohq/mondoo-operator). You can easily integrate the Mondoo Operator into your existing deployment strategies using Helm, OLM, or Kubectl. In addition, the operator will scan both your deployed workloads and your Kubernetes nodes without requiring any additional access! We're eager to hear your feedback and hope you love it as much as we do.

### ðŸ§¹ IMPROVEMENTS

**Custom Labels**

- We now support the `--annotation` flag when running scans for adding custom labels to assets.
  An enhanced view of labels on assets will be coming to the UI in an upcoming release.
