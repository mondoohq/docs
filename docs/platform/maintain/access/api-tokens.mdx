API tokens let you communicate with Mondoo's GraphQL API. With API tokens, programs can authenticate with the Mondoo API, which is useful for incorporating Mondoo in different workflows and automation.

The API token you generate can provide access to a single space or all spaces within an organization.

import Partial from "../../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}
