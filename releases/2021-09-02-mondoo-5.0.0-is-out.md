ü•≥ mondoo 5.0.0 is out!

This major version update significantly improves the way policies are
resolved and distributed to our agents. It doesn't require any changes from
you, our users, and will happen silently on the backend.

Using this new policy resolution, we are able to scale to significantly more
assets. Please reach out if you encounter any difficulties with this upgrade
via [slack](https://mondoo.link/slack) or via [support@mondoo.com](mailto:support@mondoo.com).

üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

- Switched to new policy resolution by default to improve speed and scalability
- Added baseline policies for Linux, macOS, Windows
- Signed executable and installer for Windows

üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Fixed issue where the Packer plugin would scan the local target instead of the image being built
