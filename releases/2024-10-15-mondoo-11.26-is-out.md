## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### AWS resource scan filtering

Pick and choose the exact AWS resources that Mondoo evaluates with new scan filtering.

The AWS Serverless integration now includes the ability to define AWS resources to scan with region-, instance-, and tag-based include and exclude filters. Scan just a single region or exclude resources using owner tags.

For CLI users, now you can specify a comma-separated list of tag values with the `--filters` flag.

To include only EC2 instances with the "Owner" tag of "backend", "frontend", or "dba":

```bash
--filters ec2:tag:Owner=backend,frontend,dba
```

To exclude EC2 instances with the "Owner" tag of "qa" and "dev":

```bash
--filters exclude:ec2:tag:Owner=qa,dev
```

### Custom fields for Zendesk cases

Improve the routing of cases generated in Zendesk with new globally-set custom fields.
