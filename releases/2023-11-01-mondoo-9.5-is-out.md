## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### VMware vSphere CVE detection

Mondoo now includes support for tracking CVEs and security advisories on VMware vSphere installations, so you can keep your most important on-premises assets secure. You'll automatically see CVE/advisory information on VMware vSphere assets in the Mondoo Console and you can scan assets manually on the command line to view this data as well:

```shell
cnquery shell vsphere USER@luna.dmz -p FOO
  ___ _ __   __ _ _   _  ___ _ __ _   _
 / __| '_ \ / _` | | | |/ _ \ '__| | | |
| (__| | | | (_| | |_| |  __/ |  | |_| |
 \___|_| |_|\__, |\__,_|\___|_|   \__, |
  mondoo™      |_|                |___/  interactive shell

        }

...
```

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### New AWS resource fields and defaults

The `aws.vpc.subnet` resource now includes information on the subnet's availability zone so you can better understand where subnets are located.

```coffeescript
cnquery> aws.vpcs.first.subnets{ * }
aws.vpcs.first.subnets: [
  0: {
    arn: "arn:aws:ec2:ap-south-1:177043123456:subnet/subnet-b231234"
    id: "subnet-b231234"
    cidrs: "172.31.16.0/20"
    mapPublicIpOnLaunch: true
    defaultForAvailabilityZone: true
    availabilityZone: "ap-south-1c"
  }
...
```

We've also improved the default values returned by many AWS resources to give you better output in the cnquery shell as well as query packs. These updated defaults expose AWS resource IDs, regions, availability zones, and other metadata that makes understanding your AWS infrastructure easier with Mondoo. Enable the AWS Asset Inventory Pack in your spaces to see this improved asset inventory data today.

### Improved resource output for Azure

New default values in Azure resources make exploring asset configuration in the cnquery shell or the resource explorer better than ever. You'll see new improved output on Azure VMs that show OS and hardware types. We've also expanded NIC and disk resources to show information such as the disk size/type and the NIC MAC address type.

```coffeescript
cnquery> azure.subscription.computeService.vms.first
azure.subscription.computeService.vms.first: azure.subscription.computeService.vm name="Windows-VM-5n6o" location="eastus" properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize="Standard_DS2_v2" properties.storageProfile.osDisk.osType="Windows"

cnquery> azure.subscription.computeService.disks.first
azure.subscription.computeService.disks.first: azure.subscription.computeService.disk name="Windows-VM-OsDisk-5n6o" location="eastus" properties.osType="Windows" properties.diskSizeGB=127.000000 properties.diskState="Attached"

cnquery> azure.subscription.networkService.interfaces.first
azure.subscription.networkService.interfaces.first: azure.subscription.networkService.interface name="Windows-VM-NIC-5n6o" location="eastus" properties.macAddress="60-45-BD-D7-7E-53" properties.nicType="Standard"
```

### Expanded Okta group and role capabilities

We've expanded the capabilities of our Okta provider and resources to make it easier to query your Okta configuration. You can now query Okta groups along with their roles and members using the `okta.groups` resource:

```coffeescript
cnspec> okta.groups.where(roles.one(type =="SUPER_ADMIN")) { name roles { * } members members.length < 2 }
okta.groups.where: [
  0: {
    roles: [
      0: {
        created: 2023-04-08 22:11:00 +0200 CEST
        lastUpdated: 2023-04-08 22:11:00 +0200 CEST
        assignmentType: "GROUP"
        id: "ABCD1234"
        type: "SUPER_ADMIN"
        status: "ACTIVE"
        label: "Super Administrator"
      }
    ]
    name: "Super Admins"
    members.length < 2: true
    members: [
      0: okta.user profile.email="ben@example.com"
    ]
  }
]
```

You can also check which permissions are assigned to custom roles using the new `okta.customRoles` resource:

```coffeescript
cnspec> okta.customRoles { * }
okta.customRoles: [
  0: {
    label: "Custom Role"
    id: "abc12345678910"
    description: "Custom Role"
    permissions: []
  }
]
```

### Improved host scanning

We've improved host scanning behavior with updates to Mondoo's `host` provider as well as the `http` and `tls` resources used when scanning domains and IPs. These updates make it easier to get started scanning hosts, even when the hosts aren't the best behaving.

- Default to HTTPS when no protocol information was specified on the CLI. For example, with `cnquery shell host mondoo.com` cnquery now assumes HTTPS.
- Improve handling of timeouts when checking TLS certs.
- Improve error handling and logging when connecting to hosts, parsing TLS certificates, and checking TLS on non-TLS hosts.

### Updated macOS CIS Benchmark policies

It's been just a week since we last updated macOS CIS benchmark policies, but we're back again with new updates including the official release of the CIS macOS 14.0 benchmark. These new benchmarks include improved descriptions/remediation text, more robust queries, and additional checks for Intel Macs. Be sure to check out the improved results in these releases:

- CIS Apple macOS 11.0 Big Sur Benchmark v4.0.0
- CIS Apple macOS 12.0 Monterey Benchmark v3.0.0
- CIS Apple macOS 13.0 Ventura Benchmark v2.0.0
- CIS Apple macOS 14.0 Sonoma Benchmark v1.0.0

### Improved Windows EOL dates

Windows EOL data in Mondoo Platform now tracks Microsoft's enterprise and education support track, which tends to be about one year later than consumer EOL dates. We've also added Windows 10 22H2, Windows 11 22H2, and Windows 11 23H2 releases so you can track upcoming EOL dates for all your Windows workstations.

### Improved field copy behavior

Sometimes a user suggests a fix you just can't pass up. User [@xorima](https://github.com/xorima) told us the copy icon in our text fields was hard to read and made copying important text like client installation commands difficult. We retooled the icon to make it better stand out against the text and have a more clear action when the copy was complete. Thanks [@xorima](https://github.com/xorima)!
