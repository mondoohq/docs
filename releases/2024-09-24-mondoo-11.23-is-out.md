## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Added features in cases

This release further expands the capabilities of _cases_, Mondoo's feature for tracking remediation work. Cases let you turn security findings into tasks that automatically export to your existing project management or ticket system. That way, you can track and resolve Mondoo findings in your regular workflow.

#### New support for GitHub Issues, GitLab Issues, and email ticketing

Mondoo now supports creating tickets in GitHub Issues and GitLab Issues, and can also send ticket notifications via email. These options join our existing support for ticketing with Jira and Zendesk.

#### Create cases automatically on asset drift

When scans go from passing to failing, you want to know quickly. Now when an asset fails a check or vulnerability scan that it previously passed, Mondoo creates a case and shares it with your ticket system so you can respond rapidly. Mondoo can even group similar drift findings in a single case.

### New CIS Ubuntu 24.04 benchmark policy

Secure your Ubuntu 24.04 servers and containers with the brand new CIS Ubuntu 24.04 level 1 & 2 benchmarks. These policies include 295 total checks to secure your critical Ubuntu systems.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Updated CIS Azure Foundations 3.0 benchmark policy

Evaluate your Azure subscriptions against the latest CIS recommendations with the updated CIS Azure Foundations benchmark version 3.0. This updated policy includes 15 all-new checks as well as 69 updated checks.

### Improved asset view in policies

Out with the old and in with the new: Now you can view risk scores, risk factors, and last updated times for assets directly from the policy pages.
