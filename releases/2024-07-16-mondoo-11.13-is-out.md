## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Exceptions for vendor advisories

You can now set exceptions on advisories, not just checks. To set an exception on an advisory, navigate to an asset's Advisories tab and select the advisories to snooze or disable.

To learn more, read the [Mondoo documentation](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/security/customize/advisories/).

### Choose the security scoring system for each policy in a space

Mondoo policies support several different scoring systems, depending on how you want to weight the results of the policy. While the recommended scoring mechanism for each policy is built into the policy itself, you can now override the scoring mechanism used directly from the Mondoo Console.

### Failing integration notification

Tokens may expire and accounts might change. Now you can quickly spot when integrations stop scanning as they should. Space owners will notice a new icon in the integrations menu whenever an issue arises. Plus, any failing integrations are highlighted on the Integrations page, so you can identify the problem type at a glance without diving into each page.

### Updated asset tables on individual checks

The table of affected assets on each individual check page is now much more informative, showing last update time, additional risk factors, risk score, and asset name. It also supports multi-select for building targeted cases.

### Create cases directly from policy check pages

Cases are a new feature of Mondoo that allow you to turn security findings into tasks to complete. They integrate with Atlassian Jira to fit into your existing workflow.

![Mondoo Case Management Screen](/img/releases/2024-07-09-mondoo-11.12-is-out/screenshot_cases.png)

When you see a security finding that requires fixing, you create a case for that finding. Mondoo automatically includes the details of the finding, information on the asset(s) that contain the finding, and instructions for fixing it. When you save the case, Mondoo automatically creates an issue containing all the same information in your Jira project.

To create cases from failing checks, simply open a check and click the 'Create Case' button. To learn more, read the [Mondoo documentation](https://mondoo.com/docs/platform/ticketing/overview/).

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### Updated CIS Windows 10 / 11 benchmark policies

Secure Windows endpoints with the latest CIS Windows 10 and 11 benchmark policies: version 3.0. This major version bump includes a large refactoring of the recommendations for securing Windows hosts, including new and updated recommendations, improved descriptions and remediation text, and overall improvements to queries to ensure you always have the best output to work with.
