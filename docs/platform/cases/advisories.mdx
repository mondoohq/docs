Use cases to track the work of fixing advisories in your existing workflow. When a Mondoo space has the [cases feature configured](/platform/cases/setup/), any team member can create a case from an advisory. Creating a case creates a new a Jira issue directly from the Mondoo Console.

import Partial from "../../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to a space that is set up to use cases.

2. In the side navigation bar, under **Vulnerabilities**, select **Advisories**.

3. Select the advisory you want to track using a case and a corresponding issue in Jira.

4. To the right of the asset name, select the **CREATE CASE** button and select **Selected Assets** to jump to the bottom of the page and see all assets affected by the advisory.

5. Check the boxes beside all the assets for which you want to track this advisory. Note that this creates a single case (and therefore a single Jira issue) for all the assets you choose. (If you want to track assets separately, create a new case for each asset.)

   Select the **CREATE CASE** button.

6. Select the Jira project in which you want Mondoo to add the issue. Edit the issue name and description as you wish and select the **CREATE CASE** button.

   Mondoo creates a new case in the space and a corresponding Jira issue in the project you selected.
