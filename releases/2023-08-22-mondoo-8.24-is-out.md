## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### NIST SP 800-171 Framework

Mondoo Compliance Hub now includes the NIST SP 800-171 framework, raising the total number of out-of-the-box compliance frameworks to ten. Each of the 110 controls in this framework automatically map to the checks in your infrastructure, so with a flip of a switch you can start your NIST SP 800-171 and see where you stand.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS
