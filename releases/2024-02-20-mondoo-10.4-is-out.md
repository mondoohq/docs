## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

### VMware vSphere advisory & CVE detection

Improved VMware vSphere advisory and CVE detection ensures you always have the latest advisories and CVEs flagged on both ESXi and vSphere assets.

### Resource Updates

#### aws.cloudtrail

- New `cloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn` field

#### gcp.project.pubsubService.snapshot

- Fix fetching the `expiration` field

#### npm.packages

- New resource for fetching NPM packages installed on an asset

#### packages

- New `files` field
- New `cpe` field on Windows assets

### Performance improvements

Who doesn't like getting something for free? With Mondoo 10.4, you get your scan results not only faster, but using significantly less memory at the same time. In testing with large asset scans, memory usage has dropped from ~950MB to just ~200MB, while scan times were cut in half.

### Save SBOMs to disk

Export SBOMs to a file with a new `--output-target` flag:

```text
$ cnquery sbom docker debian:12 -o cyclonedx-json --output-target debian-12.json
→ discover related assets for 1 asset(s)

 debian:12 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100%

$ head debian-12.json

```

### New Azure snapshot scanning options

New options for Azure snapshot scanning give you additional control over how Mondoo performs the scan:

- Skip the cleanup and instead rely on Azure to perform the cleanup with a new `--skip-snapshot-cleanup` flag.
- Scan snapshots that have already been attached to the VM with new `--skip-snapshot-setup` and `--lun` flags.

### Expanded NIST 800 compliance evidence

AWS NIST Best Practices policies now feed directly into Compliance Hub, so NIST security findings can be part of your automatic evidence gathering for audits.
