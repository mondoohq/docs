description: Continuously monitor your AWS asset security with Mondoo. Choose between serverless scanning and Mondoo-hosted scanning.

The Mondoo AWS integration lets you continuously monitor the security and compliance of your AWS account, EC2 instances, EKS clusters, EBS volumes, and more. Choose between a Mondoo-hosted integration and a serverless integration:

- A [Mondoo-hosted AWS integration](/platform/infra/cloud/aws/hosted/integration-hosted/) requires no agent installed to your AWS infrastructure and incurs no AWS cost. It's easy to set up and provides a higher level of stability. You can scan individual AWS accounts only; not an entire AWS Organization. This approach requires that you give Mondoo an AWS access key and secret.

- A [serverless AWS integration](/platform/infra/cloud/aws/lambda/integration-lambda/) uses an AWS Lambda function and CloudFormation to perform scheduled scans of an account or an entire AWS Organization. It doesn't require sharing AWS credentials with Mondoo. A serverless integration is more complex to set up and does incur a small AWS cost.
