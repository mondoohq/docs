Set up ticketing in a space to allow users in the space to keep track of security tasks and add GitLab issues directly from within the Mondoo Console. Ticketing setup involves configuring Mondoo to integrate with GitLab.

For an overview of ticketing, read [Track and Fix Findings with Ticketing](/platform/ticketing/overview/).

## Prerequisites

- A Mondoo account with Owner or Editor access to the space where you want to add the GitLab integration

- Access to a GitLab group

## Create a personal access token to give Mondoo access to GitLab

A _personal access token_ gives Mondoo the ability to access GitLab resources on your behalf. For Mondoo to continuously monitor your GitLab groups, you must create a personal access token.

1. Log into GitLab.

2. In the upper-left corner of any GitLab page, select your profile photo and then select **Edit Profile**.

3. In the left sidebar, select **Access tokens**.

4. Select the **Add new token** button.

5. In the **Token name** box, enter a name for the token, such as `mondoo-frontend-repo`.

6. Under **Expiration date**, specify the date on which to expire the token. (Be sure to note the expiration date so that, as it approaches, you can create a new one without interrupting the Mondoo-GitLab integration.)

7. Under **Select scopes**, check the **api** box.

8. Select the **Create a personal access token** button.

9. When GitLab finishes creating the token, it displays this message: "Your new personal access token has been created." Below the message, locate the **Your new personal access token** box. Use the copy icon to the right of the box to copy the token.

To learn more, read [Create a personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token) in the GitLab documentation.

## Add a GitLab integration

1. In the Mondoo Console, navigate to the space where you want to set up ticketing and, in the side navigation bar, select **Ticketing**.

3. Select **GitLab Issues**.

4. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that clearly shows this is a GitLab integration.

5. If you self-host GitLab, enter your custom GitLab URL in the **Provide a GitLab base URL** box. This is the URL you use to access GitLab. If you don't self-host GitLab, leave the box empty.

6. In the **Provide your personal access token** box, paste the token you copied from GitLab in the steps above.

7. To close a ticket in Mondoo when the corresponding GitLab issue closes, enable **Automatically close tickets**.

8. To create a Mondoo ticket and a corresponding GitLab issue when an asset becomes more exposed to attack, enable **Create drift issues in this integration** and enter the GitLab project where you want to create new issues. To learn more, read [Automatically create tickets on drift](/platform/ticketing/manage#automatically-create-tickets-on-drift).

9. Select the **CREATE INTEGRATION** button.
