#### Expanded version parsing in MQL

Perform complex version comparisons in your MQL code with new support for epoch and range support in the `.version()` helper.

Determine if a version is within a particular range:

```coffee
> version('1.2.3').inRange('>= 1.0.0', '< 2.0.0')
true

> version('1.2.3').inRange('1.2.0', '1.2.3')
true
```

Perform version comparisons that include epochs

```coffee
> version("1:1.0") > version("2009.12.03")
true
```

Extract epochs from a version string

```coffee
# deb/rpm-style epoch
> version("5:1.2.3").epoch
5

# python-style epoch
> version("3!2.1").epoch
3
```
