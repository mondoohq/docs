The Mondoo Google Cloud Platform (GCP) integration lets you continuously scan your GCP resources, such as compute instances and GKE service clusters.

## Requirements

- Create Service Accounts role in GCP

- The GCP IAM API enabled

- The GCP CLI

- A Mondoo account with Editor or Owner permissions for the space in which you want to add the integration.

## Create a service account for your GCP integration

To access the data it needs, your GCP integration needs a GCP service account. To learn about service accounts, read [Understanding service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) in the Google documentation.

1. Create a new GCP service account for the Mondoo integration to use.

   For instructions, read [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#iam-service-accounts-create-gcloud) in the Google documentation.

   Note the email address created for the new service account.

2. Assign the project viewer basic role to the service account: `roles/viewer`

   For instructions, read [Grant a single role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role) in the Google documentation.

3. Create a JSON key for the service account.

   For instructions, read [Create and manage service account keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#iam-service-account-keys-get-gcloud) in the Google documentation.

   Save the JSON file that downloads to your workstation when you create the key. You need it to configure the integration (in the next section below).

## Add a new GCP integration

1. Access the Integrations > Add > GCP page in one of two ways:

   - New space setup: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **GCP**.

     ![Welcome to Mondoo Page](/img/platform/start/welcome_to_mondoo.png)

   - INTEGRATIONS page: In the side navigation bar, under **INTEGRATIONS**, select **Add New Integration**. Under Cloud Security, select **GCP**.

2. To integrate your entire GCP organization with Mondoo, select **Organization**.

   OR

   To limit the integration to a single project, select **Project**.

3. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that lets you easily recognize the GCP project or organization.

4. Identify the organization or project to integrate with Mondoo.

   - For an organization: In the **Enter the organization resource ID** box, enter your organization's resource ID. To learn how to retrieve this value, read [Getting your organization resource ID](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id) in the Google documentation.

   - For a project: In the **Enter the project ID** box, enter your project's ID. To learn how to retrieve this value, read [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) in the Google documentation.

5. Under **Provide your Google Service Account config**, upload the GCP service account's JSON key that you downloaded in the previous section:

   Drag the file and drop it in the **Drag and drop your .json file here** box.

   OR

   In the **Drag and drop your .json file here** box, select the cloud icon and choose the file to upload.

6. To complete the integration, select the **START SCANNING** button.

7. On the Recommended Policies page, enable the policies on which you want to base assessments of your Google Cloud environment. To learn more, read [Manage Policies](/platform/security/posture/policies/).
