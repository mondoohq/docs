Rely on Mondoo to secure your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment. Mondoo identifies vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in compute instances, Dataproc and GKE clusters, Pub/Sub, and more.

Mondoo offers a variety of approaches to evaluating your GCP infrastructure security. You can continuously scan your GCP projects, evaluate builds before they go to production, and run ad hoc scans.

## Continuously scan

Continuously evaluate the security of your GCP resources, such as compute instances, so that you always have an up-to-date view of your environment's security posture.

With the [Mondoo GCP Integration](/platform/infra/cloud/gcp/gcp-integration-scan), you deploy the integration once and always get the latest security assessments for new accounts and resources.

## Scan during build time

- [Build secure VM images in Google Cloud with cnspec and HashiCorp Packer](/cnspec/cloud/gcp/packer/)
- [Assess risk in the Google Cloud Container Registry](/cnspec/supplychain/registry/gcp_gcr.md)
- [Build GCE custom images with HashiCorp Packer](/cnspec/supplychain/packer.md)

## Scan during run time

- [Scan a Google Cloud project with cnspec](/cnspec/cloud/gcp/)
- [Terraform deployment](/cnspec/supplychain/terraform.md)
- [Verify instances managed by Chef/AWS OpsWorks](/platform/infra/opsys/automation/chef.md)
- [Verify instances managed by Ansible](/platform/infra/opsys/automation/ansible.md)
