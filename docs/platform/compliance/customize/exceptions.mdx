_Exceptions_ let you customize how Mondoo evaluates your compliance with a framework and communicate the reasons for that customization.

Exceptions tell Mondoo to exclude certain [controls](/platform/compliance/monitor/frameworks/) when calculating your progress toward full compliance. There are two types of exceptions for controls:

- _Risk Acceptance_: Temporarily exclude control results from your overall compliance progress percentage. Risk acceptance is useful when you intend to comply with a control eventually but don't want it distracting your team right now. You can write a note justifying the delay to your team and your auditor.

- _Disable_ Permanently exclude a control from your compliance score and explain this exclusion to team. A control remains disabled unless you re-enable it.

:::tip

To exclude a control entirely from the compliance report to your auditor, [set it out of scope](/platform/compliance/customize/scope/).

You can also set exceptions on individual checks within a control. To learn more, read [Set Exceptions on Checks](/platform/compliance/customize/exceptions-checks/).

## Approve or reject an exception

Exceptions take effect the moment they're added. However, as an extra tracking step, a team member can approve or reject an exception:

- Approving an exception allows it to remain.

- Rejecting an exception removes it and re-enables the control.
