Mondoo measures your team's security improvement performance against your [service-level agreement](/glossary#service-level-agreement) (SLA). On your space dashboard, a chart compares your _committed_ time to remediate security findings against the _actual_ mean time your team takes.

Mondoo breaks down your SLA by risk score. It shows:

- Your mean time to remediate findings (MTTR) from when they're first discovered

- The number of findings that are past their SLA date and still not remediated

- The number of findings that are not yet remediated and have an SLA date approaching

These are the default commitments for remediating findings, based on risk score:

| Risk score | Days to remediate | Days until _approaching_ |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Critical   | 30                | 23                       |
| High       | 30                | 23                       |
| Medium     | 60                | 53                       |
| Low        | 90                | 83                       |

Mondoo lets you customize the SLA to match your business goals. Define the SLA in the space settings.

import Partial from "../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. [Navigate](/platform/start/navigate/) to the space in which you want to customize your SLA.

2. In the left navigation, select **Settings**. Then select the **Security Model** tab.

3. For each risk score, type a number or use the arrows to define:

   - How many days from discovery does your team commit to remediating the finding?

   - How many days after discovery do you want Mondoo to consider the SLA date _approaching_ and warn you on the space dashboard?

:: Tip

If you type new numbers, be sure to press ENTER or TAB after typing to save the change.
