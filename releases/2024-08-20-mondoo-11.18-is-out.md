## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### New policies for detecting NTLMv1 and SMBv1

Secure your Windows infrastructure against vulnerable legacy Microsoft file sharing and authentications protocols with the new Mondoo NTLMv1 Audit policy and Mondoo SMBv1 Audit policy. These policies, co-developed with the wonderful engineers at [SVA](https://sva.de/en), ensure you're using only modern and secure file sharing and authentication methods.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Space sunburst chart improvements

Quickly understand where security problems lie with improvements to the sunburst charts on the space overview page. The sunburst now groups IaC, network, and SaaS assets to quickly expose hot spots in your security posture. Dive deeper into each category with improved asset placement, so you can track down problematic services.

### Deeper AWS serverless integration scans

When a default VPC is in place, the Mondoo AWS serverless integration now produces deeper security scans that include:

- Individual assets for common AWS resources

- Improved query outputs

Use these improved scan results to navigate security issues in organization and space dashboards and to set granular exceptions on individual resources.

### Improved Compliance Hub look and feel

A refreshed Compliance Hub UI makes it easier to track your audit progress. Simplified progress bars show completion status. We also replaced the check distribution graph with intuitable icons for each exception state.

### Cover letters in compliance reports

Inform your auditor about Mondoo with a new Mondoo introduction PDF included in each compliance report. The letter explains who we are and how we collect evidence, and lets them know how to contact us if they have questions.
