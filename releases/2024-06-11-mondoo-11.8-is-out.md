## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Fine-grained cloud asset scanning

Bring greater visibility to your cloud security posture with new fine-grained asset scanning for Azure, Google Cloud, and Mondoo-hosted AWS integrations. Mondoo now discovers and scans common cloud resources such as load balancers, virtual networks, or storage buckets as individual assets, giving you improved visibility into the security posture of your most important cloud assets.

#### Expanded asset inventory

With fine-grained asset scanning you can quickly find and understand cloud assets across multiple providers or accounts—all within Mondoo. Search for resources by name or type using our newly expanded search capabilities.

Once you've found the right asset, quickly determine the location and owner with detailed asset overview data for each asset type.

#### Improved security visibility

You can now understand where critical security vulnerabilities exist within your infrastructure. With checks applied directly to cloud assets, you can more easily see which assets are pass and fail which assets fail checks without diving into complex, account-wide check output.

#### Granular exceptions

The world is full of edge cases! Now you have the granularity to account for those exceptions where necessary. With fine-grained asset scanning you can create exceptions that run on the specific cloud resources instead of on the account. This means you can disable or snooze a check without losing security visibility across your entire cloud account.

#### Common questions

**Q: Why is the cloud resource FOO not scanning as an asset?**

**A**: In this initial release, Mondoo doesn't scan every type of cloud resource independently. We've begun with common resources that include security checks in CIS Level 1 policies. We will expand our scanning coverage as time goes on and as new checks are developed. If there's a resource you'd love to see scanned as an asset in Mondoo let us know at [hello@mondoo.com](mailto:hello@mondoo.com).

**Q: Will the increase in asset counts impact billing?**

**A**: Because we believe that cost shouldn't prevent you from solving critical security findings, there is no additional charge for these assets.

### Space-wide software vulnerability page

Mondoo now provides an exhaustive list of all the vulnerable software in your infrastructure. Even better, you can precisely identify risks by digging into specific versions of packages and see everywhere they're installed. This new feature also works seamlessly with Mondoo Firewatch, automatically helping you prioritize remediation using contributing risk factors such as known exploits, running processes, and open network ports.

To get started, under **Vulnerabilities** in the main navigation, select **Software**. From there, you can access the full suite of features and immediately begin improving your infrastructure's security posture.

Individual software pages provide a breakdown of deployed package versions, software CVEs, risk factors, and which assets in your environment are running the particular software.

### Snowflake scanning

Use the new `snowflake` provider in cnquery/cnspec to query and secure critical data in your Snowflake account.

```shell
cnquery shell snowflake
```

Required arguments:

- `--account` - The Snowflake account name.
- `--region` - The Snowflake region.
- `--user` - The Snowflake username.
- `--role` - The Snowflake role.

Password authentication arguments:

- `--password` - The Snowflake password.
- `--ask-pass` - Prompt for the Snowflake password.

```shell
shell snowflake --account zi12345 --region us-central1.gcp --user CHRIS  --role ACCOUNTADMIN --ask-pass
```

Certificate authentication arguments:

- `--private-key` - The path to the private key file.

```shell
shell snowflake --account zi12345 --region us-central1.gcp --user CHRIS  --role ACCOUNTADMIN --private-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

> You need to generate a RSA key pair and assign the public key to your user via [Snowsight](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth).

#### Example Queries

**Retrieve all users**

```shell
cnquery> snowflake.account.users
snowflake.account.users: [
  0: snowflake.user name="CHRIS"
  1: snowflake.user name="DATAUSER"
  2: snowflake.user name="SNOWFLAKE"
]
```

**Retrieve all users that have no MFA**

```shell
cnquery> snowflake.account.users.where(extAuthnDuo == false)
snowflake.account.users.where: [
  0: snowflake.user name="CHRIS"
  1: snowflake.user name="DATAUSER"
  2: snowflake.user name="SNOWFLAKE"
]
```

**Retrieve all users that have password authentication**

```shell
cnquery> snowflake.account.users.where(hasPassword)
snowflake.account.users.where: [
  0: snowflake.user name="CHRIS"
  1: snowflake.user name="DATAUSER"
  2: snowflake.user name="SNOWFLAKE"
]

```

**Retrieve all users that have certificate authentication**

```shell
cnquery> snowflake.account.users.where(hasRsaPublicKey)
snowflake.account.users.where: [
  0: snowflake.user name="CHRIS"
]
```

**Retrieve users that have not logged in for 30 days**

```shell
cnquery> snowflake.account.users.where(time.now - lastSuccessLogin > time.day * 30) { lastSuccessLogin }
snowflake.account.users.where: [
  0: {
    lastSuccessLogin: 366 days
  }
]
```

**Check that SCIM is enabled**

```shell
cnquery> snowflake.account.securityIntegrations.where(type == /SCIM/).any(enabled == true)
[failed] [].any()
  actual:   []
```

**Check the retention time is greater 90 days**

```shell
cnquery> snowflake.account.parameters.one(key == "DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS" && value >= 90)
```

**Retrieve all databases**

```shell
cnquery> snowflake.account.databases
snowflake.account.databases: [
  0: snowflake.database name="CNQUERY"
  1: snowflake.database name="SNOWFLAKE"
  2: snowflake.database name="SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"
]
```

### Quick space and organization navigation
