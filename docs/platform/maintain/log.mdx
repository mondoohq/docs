description: Learn about Mondoo's audit logs
---

Mondoo tracks administrative events, such as organization and access management tasks, in audit logs. You access the logs in the Mondoo Console. There are two types of logs:

- For each organization in your account, an _organization log_ tracks member (user) access management.

- For each space in an organization, a _space log_ tracks management tasks, such as creation and deletion of service accounts and agents.

## Access a space audit log

1. [Navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to the organization that contains the space you want to see the log for.

   ![Select a Mondoo organization](/img/platform/start/select-org.png)

2. Select the space you want to see the log for.

3. In the left navigation bar, select **Settings**.

4. Select **Audit Log**.

## Access an organization audit log

1. [Navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to the organization you want to see the log for.

   ![Select a Mondoo organization](/img/platform/start/select-org.png)

2. In the left navigation bar, select **Settings**.

3. Select **Audit Log**.

## Retrieve audit logs using the API

Organization audit logs are available via Mondoo's GraphQL API. To access an organization's logs using the API, you must have:

- An [API token](/platform/maintain/access/api-tokens).

- The organization's ID. Find it on the organization page, under the organization name.

Use this GraphQL query to get the audit log for an organization, providing the organization's ID:

```
{
  "variables": {
    "first": 25,
    "resourceMrn": "//captain.api.mondoo.app/organizations/<REPLACE_WITH_ORGANIZATION_ID>"
  },
  "query": "query AuditLogForwardPagination($first: Int, $after: String, $orderBy: AuditLogOrder = {direction: DESC, field: TIMESTAMP}, $resourceMrn: String!) {
               auditlog(
                  first: $first
                  after: $after
                  orderBy: $orderBy
                  resourceMrn: $resourceMrn
               ) {
                  totalCount
                  edges {
                     cursor
                     node {
                     identity {
                        name
                        mrn
                     }
                     resource
                     action
                     timestamp
                     msg
                     }
                  }
                  pageInfo {
                     startCursor
                     endCursor
                     hasNextPage
                  }
            }
         }"
}
```

To test this task using cURL, store the query in a file named "query.json" and execute as shown below. Be sure to specify your organization ID in the query.

:::info EU region

If you're operating in the EU region, replace the `https://api.mondoo.com/query` URL with `https://eu.api.mondoo.com/query`.

```
$ cat query.json
{
  "variables": {

  },
  "query": "query AuditLogForwardPagination($first: Int, $after: String, $orderBy: AuditLogOrder = {direction: DESC, field: TIMESTAMP}, $resourceMrn: String!) {
