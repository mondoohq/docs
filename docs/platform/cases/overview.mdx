The work of improving your security posture can be daunting. Mondoo finds security issues in your infrastructure and prioritizes them so you know what problems to fix first. But how do you track the fixes and ensure that the work is completed? How do you communicate the most important tasks to your team?

*Cases* allow you to turn security findings into tasks to complete. They integrate with Atlassian Jira to fit into your existing workflow.

When you see a security finding that requires fixing, you create a case for that finding. Mondoo automatically includes the details of the finding, information on the asset(s) that contain the finding, and instructions for fixing it. When you save the case, Mondoo automatically creates an issue containing all the same information in your Jira project.

Once Mondoo creates an issue directly in Jira, you can plan, schedule, and track remediation work within your team's existing project workflow. The Jira issues that Mondoo creates from cases include all the details necessary for infrastructure owners to remediate findings, even if they don't have access to Mondoo.

In the Mondoo Console, if a security finding or an asset has a case associated with it, you can view the case from the finding or the asset. You can also see a list of all cases in a space.

You can also close cases in the Mondoo Console. When you set up cases in a Mondoo space, you choose whether closing a case in the space closes the corresponding issue in Jira.

Tracking and fixing issues with cases and Jira involves:

- [Setting up cases with a Jira integration](/platform/cases/setup/)

- [Creating cases from advisories](/platform/cases/advisories/)

- [Creating cases from checks](/platform/cases/checks/)

- [Viewing and closing cases](/platform/cases/manage/)
