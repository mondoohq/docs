## View cases and Jira issues

On the Cases page in the Mondoo Console, you can view all the cases in a space.

![Cases in Mondoo](/img/platform/cases/cases-list.png)

Select a case to open its corresponding issue in Jira.

![Jira issue created by Mondoo](/img/platform/cases/issue-in-jira.png)

:::note

Updating a Jira issue that Mondoo created from a case does not make any changes to the case.

:::

## Close a case

Close a case to indicate that the work is completed or to stop tracking it. By default, when you close a case in the Mondoo Console, Mondoo also closes the corresponding Jira issue. However, you can change this when you first set up cases for the space. To learn how, read [Set up Cases and Jira](/platform/cases/setup/).

:::note

Closing an issue in Jira does not close the corresponding case in Mondoo.

:::

import Partial from "../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. In the Mondoo Console's side navigation bar, select **Cases**.
