This is the first step in the quick setup for an Azure subscription.

## Step A: Retrieve your subscription ID and tenant ID

You can give your app READ access to one or several subscriptions.

1. In the Azure CLI, find the ID(s) of the subscription(s) you want to monitor by entering:

   ```bash
   az account subscription list
   ```

   OR

   ```bash
   az account list
   ```

The Azure CLI provides information about all your subscriptions across all tenants. Each entry has an `id` value.

2. Copy the `id` value for each of the subscriptions you want to integrate with Mondoo. Paste the value(s) somewhere handy to use later.

3. Copy the `tenantId` value and paste it somewhere handy to use later.
