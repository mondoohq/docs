When Mondoo scans an asset, it calculates a percentage score to assess the risk the assets presents to your business.

Mondoo scoring is based on [policies](/platform/security/posture/pac/) that match the type of asset scanned. For example, there are policies for Windows, Linux, Kubernetes clusters, and so on. You [choose which policies are enabled](/platform/security/posture/policies/) in a space. If an asset matches multiple policies enabled in a space, Mondoo combines all matching policies to evaluate the asset's risk.

Mondoo scores policies from 0 (critical risk) to 100 (no risk) based on percentage scores:

| From... | To... | Risk score | Description                                    |
|:-------:|:-----:|:----------:| :---------------------------------------------:|
| 0       | 10    | CRITICAL   | Presents extreme risk to your organization     |
| 11      | 30    | HIGH       | Presents significant risk to your organization |
| 31      | 60    | MEDIUM     | Presents moderate risk to your organization    |
| 61      | 99    | LOW        | Presents little risk to your organization      |
| 100     | 100   | NONE       | Presents no risk to your organization          |
