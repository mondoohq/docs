The Mondoo PostgreSQL integration lets you continuously export your space data, such as assets, vulnerabilities, and scan results, to a PostgreSQL database. The export runs approximately every 24 hours.

## Requirements

To export data to PostgreSQL you must have a PostgreSQL database already created. The database must:

- Run using port 5432. This is the default PostgreSQL port.

- Be externally accessible; it can't be behind a firewall or used a blocked port.

- You must have Editor or Owner access to the space from which you want to export data

To learn about setting up a PostgreSQL database, read the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## Add a new PostgreSQL integration

1. Access the Integrations > Add > PostgreSQL page in one of two ways:

   - New space setup: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **PostgreSQL**.

     ![Welcome to Mondoo Page](/img/platform/start/welcome_to_mondoo.png)

   - INTEGRATIONS page: Navigate to **INTEGRATIONS**. Under Exports, select **PostgreSQL**.

2. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that lets you easily recognize the PostgreSQL data warehouse.

3. In the **Database server host** box, enter the IP address or FQDN of the server to which you want to export Mondoo data.

4. Under **Enter your credentials**, enter the user name and password for your PostgreSQL account.

5. To complete the integration, select the **CREATE EXPORT** button.

   Mondoo begins exporting information from your space. When this initial export completes, the integration status becomes **ACTIVE**. Mondoo performs an export approximately every 24 hours.

## View your PostgreSQL integration

1. In the side navigation bar, under Integrations, select **PostgreSQL**.

2. In the list of PostgreSQL integrations, select the integration you want to view.

### Statuses

The possible statuses for a PostgreSQL integration are:

- **ACTIVE**: The integration is active/healthy.
- **PENDING**: Mondoo has not yet tried to connect to PostgreSQL.
- **ERROR**: Mondoo detected an error during export.

### Export data to PostgreSQL at any time

Mondoo exports your data to PostgreSQL approximately every 24 hours. You can also manually export data at any time. Use the **SCHEDULE NOW** button to request an export right away. Mondoo begins the export as soon as possible.

### Remove an integration

To remove an integration, select the trash can icon. A confirmation prompt displays. Once you confirm the deletion, Mondoo removes the configured integration and stops triggering exports to the PostgreSQL database.

:::info

Mondoo does not delete existing exported data. You must delete the data manually.
