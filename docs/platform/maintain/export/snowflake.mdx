The Mondoo Snowflake integration lets you continuously export your space data, such as assets, vulnerabilities, and scan results, to a Snowflake database. The export runs approximately every 24 hours.

## Requirements

To export data to Snowflake you must have a Snowflake account, database, warehouse, and schema already defined. To learn about setting these up, read the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/).

### Find your Snowflake account ID and region ID

Mondoo needs the ID and region ID of a Snowflake account to which to export data. To find it:

1. Log into the [Snowflake web-based UI](https://app.snowflake.com/).

2. Find the Snowflake logo at the bottom-left corner of the window. Select the nearby dropdown arrow and then hover over your user ID for the account to which you want to export data.

3. Find the **Locator** value. This is the account ID that Mondoo requires.

4. Find the **Region** value. Snowflake shows the description of the region, such as `US Central 1 (Iowa)`. Instead of the description, Mondoo needs the ID, such as `us-central1.gcp`.

## Add a new Snowflake integration

1. Access the Integrations > Add > Snowflake page in one of two ways:

   - New space setup: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **Snowflake**.

     ![Welcome to Mondoo Page](/img/platform/start/welcome_to_mondoo.png)

   - INTEGRATIONS page: Navigate to **INTEGRATIONS**. Under Exports, select **Snowflake**.

2. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that lets you easily recognize the Snowflake data warehouse.

3. In the **Snowflake Account ID** box, enter the account's **Locator** value. To learn more, read the _Find your Snowflake account ID and region ID_ section above.

4. In the **Database** box, enter the name of the database to which you want to export Mondoo data.

5. In the **Warehouse** box, enter the name of the warehouse to which you want to export Mondoo data.

6. In the **Schema** box, enter the name of the schema to use for the export.

7. In the **Region** box, enter the region ID. To learn more, read the _Find your Snowflake account ID and region ID_ section above.

8. Under **Account credentials**, enter the user name and password for your Snowflake account.

9. If you require a specific role to access the database you've specified, enter that role in the **Role** box.

10. To complete the integration, select the **CREATE INTEGRATION** button.

    Mondoo begins exporting information from your space. When this initial export completes, the integration status becomes **ACTIVE**. Mondoo performs an export approximately every 24 hours.

## View your Snowflake integration

1. In the side navigation bar, under Integrations, select **Snowflake**.

2. In the list of Snowflake integrations, select the integration you want to view.

### Statuses

The possible statuses for a Snowflake integration are:

- **ACTIVE**: The integration is active/healthy.
- **PENDING**: Mondoo has not yet attempted to connect to Snowflake.
- **ERROR**: Mondoo detected an error during export.

### Export data to Snowflake at any time

Mondoo exports your data to Snowflake approximately every 24 hours. You can also manually export data at any time. Use the **SCHEDULE NOW** button to request an export right away. Mondoo begins the export as soon as possible. If Mondoo is processing a lot of data, there can be some delay until Mondoo has sufficient resources.

### Remove an integration

To remove an integration, select the trash can icon. A confirmation prompt displays. Once you confirm the deletion, Mondoo removes the configured integration and stops triggering exports to the Snowflake database.

:::info

Mondoo does not delete existing exported data. You must delete the data manually.
