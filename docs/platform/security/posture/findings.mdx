Mondoo helps you prioritize fixes by moving beyond static severity ratings. We analyze every finding through the lens of your unique environment, calculating a contextual **Risk Score** for each one. These scores then power our **Top Actions** feature, a focused list of the most impactful remediations for your infrastructure.

This allows you to spend less time sifting through thousands of alerts and more time closing the security gaps that matter most.

### What Are Security Findings?

Security findings are potential issues that can make your infrastructure vulnerable to attack. The Mondoo Console reveals security findings in all the assets you integrate with Mondoo. Findings include:

- Misconfigurations that can expose your infrastructure to attackers
- Known vulnerabilities (or CVEs, common vulnerabilities and exposures) in the software installed on your assets
- Advisories published by software makers to alert the public about gaps in their products

### How Mondoo Calculates Risk Score

The foundation of prioritization is an accurate, contextual Risk Score. Mondoo assigns a score of Low, Medium, High, or Critical to each finding by combining a base score with contextual risk factors.

#### Begin with a base score

Each finding has a base score associated with it.

- For **misconfigurations**, the base score comes from the _impact score_ of the failed check in a Mondoo policy.
- For **CVEs and advisories**, the base score is the [CVSS score](/platform/security/posture/vulnerabilities/#cvss-score-and-metrics).

#### Factor contextual risk

Base scores evaluate a threat in a vacuum. Mondoo makes them more accurate by applying _contextual risk factors_ that are unique to your assets and environment.

| Risk Factor | Description | Affect on Risk Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Internet-facing** | The asset has a public IP address and is exposed to the internet. | Raise |
| **Remote exploit** | The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without user interaction. | Raise |
| **Accessible keys** | Key or credential information is exposed on the asset. | Raise |
| **In use** | The asset has a running service or is in active use. | Raise |
| **End-of-life (EOL)** | The asset is running an EOL operating system. | Raise |
| **Database** | The asset hosts a running database. | Raise |
| **Defensive** | The asset has defensive countermeasures (SELinux or AppArmor). | Lower |

### From Risk Score to Top Actions

While individual risk scores are important, the key to efficient remediation is understanding collective impact. Mondoo analyzes the risk scores of all findings across all your assets to identify which issues, if fixed, will provide the largest measurable improvement to your security posture.

These critical issues are presented to you in a curated list called **Top Actions**.
