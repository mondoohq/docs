## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### All New Fleet View Experience

**Problem:** You have hundreds or thousands of assets in Mondoo. Finding types of systems and understanding the relationships between assets is difficult.

**Solution** We added a whole new fleet view experience to Mondoo that groups your assets by type. You can quickly assess the security of different elements in your infrastructure and grasp interconnected security relationships.

### CIS AKS and GKE Benchmarks

**Problem:** You want secure your AKS and GKE clusters and workloads.

**Solution:** Mondoo now includes CIS Level 1 and 2 benchmarks for both Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). These policies include critical controls for securing your cluster nodes and cluster workloads.

### Scan All Kubernetes Resources in Manifests

**Problem:** You need to scan each Kubernetes resource in your manifests as an individual asset in Mondoo so you can apply the new Mondoo Kubernetes Security and Best Practices policies.

**Solution:** Mondoo scans now respect the `--discover all` command line flag when scanning local manifests. This lets you scan individual Kubernetes resources and even the containers defined in your manifests.

## üßπ IMPROVEMENTS

### Quickly Find Kubernetes Operator Scanned Assets

**Problem:** You set up your Kubernetes Mondoo integration and now you want to view the discovered assets.

**Solution:** We added a new `See Your Asset Scores` link in the Kubernetes Integration pages that takes you right to all the assets discovered by the Mondoo Operator.

### Priorities in Kubernetes Policies

**Problem:** You've scanned your Kubernetes cluster, and there's a mountain of work to do. Where should you start?

**Solution:** We've added priorities to the controls in CIS and Mondoo Kubernetes policies. You can now sort your scan results by priority and tackle the most important security issues first.

### Improved `mondoo shell` and `mondoo exec` Experiences

**Problem:** Mondoo 6.0 introduced new simpler command syntax and it's been **so great** that now you can't remember the old syntax when you run `mondoo shell` or `mondoo exec`.

**Solution:** We've updated `mondoo shell` and `mondoo exec` to use the same simpler syntax as `mondoo scan`. No more `-t` flag or `://` format. Just run `mondoo shell TRANSPORT_NAME`.

### Expanded and Improved CIS Kubernetes Policy

We've made several improvements to the vanilla CIS Kubernetes Level 1 and 2 policies for Master and Worker Nodes. Many controls previously marked as `not implemented` are now implemented and all file permission controls now pass when permissions are more secure than those required by CIS.

## üêõ BUG FIXES AND UPDATES

- Properly redirects users to the `Welcome to Mondoo` page after verifying their email during sign-up.
- Improves the error message guidance when an AWS fails to check-in.
- Fixes the See Your Scores link in the AWS integrations pages to properly load the list of account assets.
- Properly detects the path to Grub2 configs in CIS benchmarks on Amazon Linux.
