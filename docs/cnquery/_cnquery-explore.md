Use the `cnquery scan` command to explore an asset's configuration based on a query pack. This command retrieves an asset's configuration details. For example, you can scan the local system with its pre-configured query pack.

```bash
cnquery scan local
```

<!-- To manually specify a query pack, use this command:

```bash
cnquery scan TARGET --querypack PACK
```

|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TARGET` | The asset to scan, such as local or a transport to a remote machine.    |
| `PACK`   | The query pack YAML file.                                               |

This example scans the local machine using a policy bundle named preaudit:

```bash
cnquery scan local --querypack preaudit.yaml
```
