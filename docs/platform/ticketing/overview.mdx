The work of improving your security posture can be daunting. Mondoo finds security issues in your infrastructure and prioritizes them so you know what problems to fix first. But how do you track the fixes and ensure that the work is completed? How do you communicate the most important tasks to your team?

*Ticketing* allows you to turn security findings into tasks to complete. Mondoo tickets integrate with your external ticket system (issue tracking software), such as Zendesk, GitHub, or Atlassian Jira, to fit into your existing workflow.

When you see a security finding that requires fixing, you create a Mondoo ticket for that finding. In the new ticket, Mondoo automatically includes the details of the finding, information on the asset(s) containing the finding, and instructions for fixing it. When you save the ticket, Mondoo can do any of these actions:

- Directly create an Azure DevOps issue

- Directly create a GitHub issue

- Directly create a GitLab issue

- Directly create a Jira issue

- Directly create a Zendesk ticket

- Send an email message to your ticket system (or any destination)

## Directly integrate Mondoo with your ticket system

If you directly configure Mondoo with your external ticket system, for every new Mondoo ticket you create, Mondoo creates a corresponding issue or ticket in your external ticket system. Then you can plan, schedule, and track remediation work within your team's existing project workflow.

Get started with a direct integration:

- [Azure DevOps](/platform/ticketing/setup-azuredevops/)

- [GitHub](/platform/ticketing/setup-github/)

- [GitLab](/platform/ticketing/setup-gitlab/)

- [Jira](/platform/ticketing/setup/)

- [Zendesk](/platform/ticketing/setup-zendesk/)

## Integrate Mondoo with your ticket system using email

If you configure Mondoo to send email to your ticket system, each time you create a new Mondoo ticket, Mondoo sends an email message to the recipient you choose. Typically, this is the email address set up as a listener (or similar service) for your project management, ticketing, or issue tracking software. Some examples are the Zendesk email channel, ServiceNow inbound email, and the Jira incoming mail handler.

## Track and fix findings

In the Mondoo Console, if a security finding or an asset has a ticket associated with it, you can view the ticket from the finding or the asset. You can also see a list of all tickets in a space.

You can view and close tickets in the Mondoo Console. When you set up ticketing in a Mondoo space, you choose whether closing a Mondoo ticket in the space closes the corresponding issue or ticket in your external tracking system.

The email messages or external issues that Mondoo creates based on Mondoo tickets include all the details necessary for infrastructure owners to remediate findings. This gives all team members the information they need to address security issues, even if they don't have access to Mondoo.

Tracking and fixing findings with ticketing involves:

- [Creating tickets from advisories](/platform/ticketing/advisories/)

- [Creating tickets from checks](/platform/ticketing/checks/)

- [Viewing and closing tickets and managing ticketing settings](/platform/ticketing/manage/)

## Automatically create tickets when drift is detected

If an asset has become more exposed to attack since the last time Mondoo scanned it, that's _drift_. Mondoo can create a ticket when it detects drift. It can even group together multiple instances of the same drift on different assets. To learn more, read [Automatically create tickets on drift](/platform/ticketing/manage#automatically-create-tickets-on-drift).
