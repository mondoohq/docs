description: This document covers the configuration and use of the Mondoo AWS serverless integration to scan AWS accounts and EC2 instances
---

The Mondoo serverless AWS integration enables continuous cron-scheduled and [event-based](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-service-event.html) scanning of your AWS account or Organization.

To learn about how an integration runs and its required permissions, read [AWS Integration FAQ](/platform/infra/cloud/aws/lambda/aws-integration-faq/).

:::info

Mondoo also offers a Mondoo-hosted method for assessing AWS security. It requires no agent in AWS and is easier to set up. To compare the two approaches, read [Continuously Scan with an AWS Integration](/platform/infra/cloud/aws/aws-integration-scan/).

:::

## Integrate with an entire organization or single account

The serverless Mondoo AWS integration supports scanning multiple AWS accounts. To do this, you install Mondoo across an AWS Organization using CloudFormation StackSets. All scan configuration options you choose apply to every AWS account in the AWS Organization.

:::caution IMPORTANT

Before creating a serverless Mondoo deployment on an AWS Organization, be sure the configuration of your AWS Organization meets the [requirements](/platform/infra/cloud/aws/lambda/aws-integration-troubleshooting/#requirements-for-deploying-the-mondoo-stackset-at-the-organization-level).

:::

You can also opt to scan a single AWS account only. Single account integrations rely on CloudFormation stacks.

:::info
When you deploy an integration with Mondoo using a StackSet on the organizational level, the StackSet only creates an integration of the [target accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html#stacksets-concepts-accts).

The [administrator account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html#stacksets-concepts-accts) in which the StackSet for the target accounts resides needs its own separate [single account integration](/platform/infra/cloud/aws/lambda/integration-lambda/#integrate-with-an-entire-organization-or-single-account).

This follows the [architectural concepts of AWS StackSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html).

## Set up a new AWS integration

import Partial from "../../../../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. Access the Integrations > Add > AWS page in one of two ways:

   - **New space setup**: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **AWS**.

     ![Welcome to Mondoo Page](/img/platform/start/welcome_to_mondoo.png)

   - **INTEGRATIONS page**: In the side navigation bar, under **INTEGRATIONS**, select **Add New Integration**. Near the top of the page, select **AWS**.

   ![AWS integration options](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/hosted-or-serverless.png)

2. Select the **SELECT SERVERLESS INTEGRATION** button.

   ![Create a serverless AWS integration in Mondoo](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/add-aws-top.png)

3. Give the new integration a name that is easy to recognize as an AWS integration and differentiates it from any other AWS integrations.

4. Select the type of integration:

   | Option                     | Description                                       |
   | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Organization install**   | Integrate Mondoo with an entire AWS Organization. |
   | **Single account install** | Integrate Mondoo with a single AWS account.       |

5. Select the region in which you want to deploy the integration.

6. Choose whether to use the region's default virtual private cloud (VPC) or to create a new VPC dedicated for Mondoo's use.

   - If you select **AWS default VPC**, be sure the selected region has a default VPC. Every VPCs created after 2013 has a default VPC unless it's been deleted. To check in the AWS console, choose the region, go to the VPC service, and select **VPCs**.

   - If you select **Mondoo-created VPC**, in the **Configure CIDR** box, specify an IPv4 address range for the VPC that Mondoo creates. To learn more, read [VPC CIDR blocks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-cidr-blocks.html) in the AWS documentation.

7. In the **Schedule full scan** box, set the interval (in hours) at which to execute a full scan of the AWS account, independent of change [events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-service-event.html). The default is 12 hours.

8. Set the EC2 options:

   ![Mondoo serverless AWS integration EC2 options](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/add-aws-ec2.png)

   | Option                                                                                                                        | Description                                                                                                                        |
   | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Discover EC2 instances**                                                                                                    | Include EC2 instances in asset discovery. By default, this applies across all regions.                                             |
   | **Trigger on instance state change [events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-service-event.html)** | Trigger a scan of all EC2 instances whenever an instance changes state.                                                            |
   | [**Use SSM for instance connectivity**](/docs/cnspec/cloud/aws/aws-ssm-scan)                                          | Use the AWS SSM service to trigger scans for EC2 instances (when it's available).                                                  |
   | **Use EC2 Instance Connect for instance connectivity**                                                                        | If an EC2 instance has a public IP, connect using EC2 Instance Connect.                                                            |
   | **Use EBS volume scanning for instance connectivity**                                                                         | Use _EBS volume scanning_ to scan the filesystems of instances that Mondoo otherwise can't reach. This includes stopped instances. |

9. If desired, limit the resources that Mondoo scans:

   ![Mondoo serverless AWS EC2 filtering](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/aws-filter.png)

   For each filtering option, you can either:

      - Scan only the resources that match your allow list

      OR

      - Scan all resources except those that match your deny list

   Choose any combination of filters:

      - Enable **Filter by instance IDs** to limit EC2 instance scanning to a subset of IDs or scan all EC2 instances except specified IDs. This setting does not affect scanning of other types of resources. Enter each ID on a new line. For example:

         ```
         i-0d1f840578ca82600
         i-07ae83fe5d22600a
         ```


   | Option                     | Description                                                                    | Example                                  |
   | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
   | **Filter by instance IDs** | Limit EC2 instance scanning to a subset of IDs or scan all EC2 instances except specified IDs. This setting does not affect scanning of other types of resources. | `i-0d1f840578ca82600
   i-07ae83fe5d22600a` |
   | **Filter by regions**      | Limit scanning to a subset of regions or scan all resources except those in the region specified. | `eu-east-1
   us-east-2`                    |
   | **Filter by tags**         | Limit resource scanning to a subset of tags or scan all resources except those with the specified tags. Enter tags using the format `key:value`. To allow or deny multiple values of the same tag key, separate them with commas: `key:value1, value2, value3`. | `Name:test
   env:test
   Environment:stage,test,qa,edge`                |

10. Specify whether you want to scan containers and container images:

   ![Mondoo serverless AWS integration container options](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/containers.png)

   | Option                                                                                                                        | Description                                                                                                                        |
   | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Discover and scan ECS containers**                                                                                                    | Discover AWS Fargate containers and scan them using [ECS Exec](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-exec.html). |
   | **Discover and scan container images** | Discover container images and scan them for security misconfigurations. |

11. Select the **START SCANNING** button.

   ![Create an AWS integration and launch CloudFormation](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/launch-cf.png)

11. Follow the instructions to launch the AWS CloudFormation stack (for an account) or StackSet (for an Organization).

:::caution IMPORTANT

Selecting **START SCANNING** does not finalize the integration between Mondoo and AWS. You must launch the AWS CloudFormation stack or StackSet to complete the setup.

## Manage an AWS integration

You can view the status of an AWS integration, change its configuration options, and more on its integration page.

<Partial />{" "}

To access an existing integration:

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to the space containing the integration.

2. In the side navigation bar, under **Integrations**, select **AWS**.

   ![integration-list-image](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/list.png)

3. Select the integration you want to view or manage.

   ![integration-detail-image](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/integration-overview.png)

### View an integration's status

Mondoo shows the status at the top of the integration page, beside the integration name.

![Mondoo AWS integration status and actions](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/integration-scan-now.png)

### Ping an integration

At the top of the integration page, below the integration name, Mondoo shows the time of the last ping.

To ping the integration now, select the ping icon (a heartbeat to the left of the **SCAN NOW** button).

### Request a fresh scan

To see fresh scan results, select the **SCAN NOW** button. Mondoo retrieves new scan results as soon as possible.

### Stop all running scans

<Partial />{" "}

To stop all currently running AWS scans, on the ellipsis menu of the integration page, select **Cancel Scans**.

![Stop an AWS scan in Mondoo](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/dotmenu.png)

### Enable and disable policies for an AWS integration

The **RECOMMENDED POLICIES** tab on the integration page lists policies that can help you protect your AWS environment. It shows which policies are enabled and disabled.

<Partial />{" "}

![Policies for a Mondoo AWS integration](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/integration-policies.png)

Use the toggle on the right side of each policy's row to enable or disable the policy.

To learn more about policies, read [Policy as Code](/platform/security/posture/pac/).

### Reconfigure an AWS integration
