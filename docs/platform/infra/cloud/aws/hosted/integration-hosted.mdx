description: This document covers the configuration and use of the Mondoo-hosted AWS integration to scan AWS accounts and EC2 instances
---

A Mondoo-hosted AWS integration provides continuous security and compliance scanning for an AWS account without installing any agents in your AWS or incurring additional AWS cost. An AWS access key gives Mondoo integration the access it needs to continuously scan your AWS account. To learn about AWS access keys, read [Managing access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) in the AWS documentation.

:::info

Mondoo also offers a serverless method for assessing AWS security. It provides cron-scheduled and event-based continuous scanning of your AWS accounts or your entire AWS Organization using a Lambda function. To compare the two approaches, read [Continuously Scan with an AWS Integration](/platform/infra/cloud/aws/aws-integration-scan/).

## Create an AWS user and access key for Mondoo

To give Mondoo the access it needs to continuously scan your AWS account, create an AWS user and access key. You give the key and its secret to Mondoo, which securely stores them.

1. In the **AWS access portal** for the account you want to integrate with Mondoo, go to **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**.

2. In the left menu, select **Users**.

3. Select the **Create user** button.

   ![AWS IAM users](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/create-user.png)

4. Enter the user name `Mondoo` and select the **Next** button.

5. Select **Attach policies directly**.

6. Search for `ReadOnlyAccess` and check the box next to the permission named simply **ReadOnlyAccess**. The ARN for this permission is `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess`.

7. Select the **Next** button and then select the **Create User** button.

8. In the success confirmation message, select the **View user** button.

9. Select the **Security Credentials** tab.

   ![AWS IAM users](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/creds.png)

10. Under **Access Keys**, select the **Create access key** button.

11. Select **Third-party service**, check the **I understand the above recommendation and want to proceed to create an access key** box, and select the **Next** button.

   ![AWS IAM users](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/key-description.png)

12. Enter a description for the key and select the **Create access key** button.

13. Keep the page with the key open in your browser as you continue to the next steps.

## Set up a new AWS integration

import Partial from "../../../../partials/_editor-owner.mdx";

<Partial />{" "}

1. In a new browser window, access the Integrations > Add > AWS page in one of two ways:

   - **New space setup**: After creating a new Mondoo account or creating a new space, the initial setup guide welcomes you. Select **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** and then select **AWS**.

     ![Welcome to Mondoo Page](/img/platform/start/welcome_to_mondoo.png)

   - **INTEGRATIONS page**: In the side navigation bar, under **INTEGRATIONS**, select **Add New Integration**. Near the top of the page, select **AWS**.

   ![AWS integration options](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/hosted-or-serverless.png)

2. Select **Mondoo-Hosted**.

   ![integration-create-image](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/add-hosted-top.png)

3. In the **Choose an integration name** box, type a recognizable name for this AWS asset.

4. Access the AWS IAM tab in your browser that shows the access keys you created in the steps above. Copy the **Access key**.

   ![AWS access portal](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/keys.png)

5. In the Mondoo Console tab in your browser, under **Enter authentication details**, paste the value in the **Access Key ID** box.

   ![AWS access keys](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/auth.png)

6. In the AWS IAM tab in your browser, copy the **Secret access key** value.

7. In the Mondoo Console tab in your browser, under **Enter authentication details**, paste the value in the **AWS secret access key** box.

8. Select the **START SCANNING** button.

## Manage an AWS integration

You can view the status of an AWS integration, change its configuration options, and more on its integration page.

<Partial />{" "}

To access an existing integration:

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to the space containing the integration.

2. In the side navigation bar, under **Integrations**, select **AWS**.

   ![integration-list-image](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/list.png)

3. Select the integration you want to view or manage.

   ![integration-detail-image](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/integration-overview.png)

### View an integration's status

Mondoo shows the status at the top of the integration page, beside the integration name.

![Mondoo AWS integration status and actions](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/integration-scan-now.png)

Theses are the possible statuses for an AWS integration:

| Status          | Meaning                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **configuring** | Mondoo is sending the scan configuration options to the integration and the integration is saving those options. |
| **active**      | The integration is active and healthy.                                                                           |
| **error**       | Mondoo detected an error during installation.                                                                    |
| **missing**     | Mondoo hasn't received a check-in from the Lambda function for over an hour.                                     |
| **deleted**     | CloudFormation for the integration has been deleted.                                                             |

### Ping an integration

At the top of the integration page, below the integration name, Mondoo shows the time of the last ping.

To ping the integration now, select the ping icon (a heartbeat to the left of the **SCAN NOW** button).

### Request a fresh scan

<Partial />{" "}

To see fresh scan results, select the **SCAN NOW** button. Mondoo retrieves new scan results as soon as possible.

### Enable and disable policies for an AWS integration

The **RECOMMENDED POLICIES** tab on the integration page lists policies that can help you protect your AWS environment. It shows which policies are enabled and disabled.

![Policies for a Mondoo AWS integration](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/integration-policies.png)

Use the toggle on the right side of each policy's row to enable or disable the policy.

<Partial />{" "}

To learn more about policies, read [Policy as Code](/platform/security/posture/pac/).

### Remove an integration

<Partial />{" "}

To remove an integration, select the Remove (trash can) icon at the top of the integration page.

![Remove an AWS Mondoo integration](/img/platform/infra/cloud/aws/integration-scan-now.png)

A notification displays with a link to the CloudFormation Stacks list in the AWS console. Select the link and, in the AWS console, delete the stack. This removes the configured integration from Mondoo Platform and deletes the rule allowing the Mondoo AWS account to send events to the target account.
