Mondoo comes stocked with a constantly growing collection of policies, which are codified benchmarks used to assess your infrastructure. Policies control what misconfigurations and security issues Mondoo checks for when it evaluates your digital business assets. Mondoo's built-in policies are production ready, simple to deploy and customize in any environment, and actionable.

Mondoo continuously assesses your systems according to the policies _you enable_. In Mondoo, you enable and disable policies separately for each space in your organization. When you create a new space, it contains a default set of policies.

Managing policies involves:

- **Enabling a policy** to use it as a basis for scanning assets in the space
- **Disabling a policy** to stop using it in the space
- **Previewing a policy** to use it as a basis for scanning but exclude it from scoring

Any policies you enable, disable, preview in a space affect only that space.

To learn more about Mondoo policies, read [Policy as Code](/platform/security/posture/pac/).

## Manage policies for a space

1. In the [Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com), [navigate](/platform/start/navigate) to the space.

2. In the side navigation bar, under **Findings**, select **Policies**.

   ![Mondoo - navigate to the security policies for a space](/img/platform/security/policies.png)

The Policies page shows all the policies enabled for the space.

:::tip

You can also see enabled policies from the cnspec command line. To learn more, read [cnspec policy list](/cnspec/cli/cnspec_policy_list/).

:::

## Disable policies

Disable a policy to stop using that policy as a basis for assessing the security of assets in the space.

:::caution

Disabling a policy deletes any existing reports from that policy in the space.

:::

1. Access the Policies page for the space as instructed above.

2. Locate the policy you want to disable by scrolling through the list of available policies or using the **Filter** search box.

3. Check the box next to the policy (or policies) you want to delete and then select the **DISABLE POLICY** button.

   ![Mondoo - disable a policy for a space](/img/platform/security/disable-preview.png)

Changes take effect immediately. The next time Mondoo scans applicable assets in the space, it does not include this policy.

You can also disable a policy from the cnspec command line. To learn more, read [cnspec policy disable](/cnspec/cli/cnspec_policy_disable/).

## Change policies from enabled to preview

Preview a policy to use the policy as a basis for evaluating assets in the space but **not score** the policy. When Mondoo calculates an asset's overall score, it doesn't factor in how the asset performs in the scan based on this policy. When Mondoo calculates a space's or an organization's overall score, it doesn't factor in how any assets perform in a scan based on this policy.

<Partial />{" "}

1. Access the security policies list for the space as described above.

2. Locate the policy you want to preview by scrolling through the list of available policies or using the **Filter** search box.

3. Check the box next to the policy (or policies) you want to delete and then select the **PREVIEW POLICY** button.

   ![Mondoo - preview a policy for a space](/img/platform/security/disable-preview.png)

Changes take effect immediately. The next time Mondoo scans applicable assets in the space, it includes this policy's results but not its scores.
