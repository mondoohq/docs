Give people and software access to your Mondoo organizations and spaces:

- Grant your [team members](/platform/maintain/access/team_members) different levels access to Mondoo organizations and spaces.

- Integrate Mondoo with [Okta](/platform/maintain/access/scim-okta) to provide single-sign-on with OIDC and manage user access with SCIM 2.0.

- Integrate Mondoo with [Microsoft Entra](/platform/maintain/access/scim-ms) to provide single-sign-on with OIDC and manage user access with SCIM 2.0.

- Use [service accounts](/platform/maintain/access/service_accounts) or [API tokens](/platform/maintain/access/api-tokens) to authenticate external services (such as CI pipelines) with the Mondoo Platform APIs.
