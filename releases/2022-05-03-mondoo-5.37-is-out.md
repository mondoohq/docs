## 🎉 NEW FEATURES

### Expanded Windows Platform Support

**New and Updated CIS Benchmarks**

New CIS Windows 11 and Windows 2022 benchmarks version 1.0 are available in the Mondoo Policy Hub. We've also updated our existing CIS benchmarks for Windows to the latest CIS releases:

- Windows 2016 updated to 1.3.0
- Windows 2019 updated to 1.3.0
- Windows 10 updated to 1.12.0

**Windows 10 and 11 Security Advisories**

The Mondoo Platform Vulnerability Policy now includes security advisory and CVE reporting for Windows 10 and 11. We've also made improvements to ensure that systems with many security advisories correctly report the complete set.

**Kubernetes Deployment Scans**

The Mondoo Kubernetes operator's admission controller now includes full scanning of each Kubernetes deployment and pod. With the admission controller enabled, these scans will show up in the fleet view. See the [mondoo-operator](https://github.com/mondoohq/mondoo-operator) repo for more details. Stay tuned for a guided operator setup and improved UI experience coming soon.

## 🧹 IMPROVEMENTS

**New `ssh-host-key` id-detector**

You can now identify the system you're scanning through the `ssh-host-key` with the `--id-detector` CLI flag.

```bash
mondoo scan --id-detector ssh-host-key
```

**New Ubuntu Security Advisory Data**

The Mondoo Platform Vulnerability Policy now includes security advisory data for Ubuntu 22.04 and the upcoming Ubuntu 22.10 release.

**New UI Color Theme**

The Mondoo CLI output has a new color theme to better match the output you see in the Mondoo Console.

**Improved Output in Kubernetes Application Benchmark**

The output in the Kubernetes Application Benchmark by Mondoo now displays the pod name and namespace in the query output. With this information, you can trace vulnerable pods back to their manifests.

**Pop!\_OS Support**

Mondoo now detects and scans the Pop!\_OS Linux distribution by System76.

## 🐛 BUGFIXES

- Fix loading of `id-detector` config option for `mondoo scan`
- Fix handling of non-existing registry keys on Windows
- Fix several detection errors in Mondoo Security Baseline policies:
  - Improve reliability of auditd state to prevent errors checking state
  - Don't fail when `/etc/group-` doesn't exist on a system
  - Add a new query on Windows hosts to make sure users don't have the privilege to attach debuggers
