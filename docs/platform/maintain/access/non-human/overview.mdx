Mondoo offers a number of ways to allow non-human users to access your organization and spaces. Non-human users can include services, scripts, apps, and more.

- [Service accounts](/platform/maintain/access/non-human/service_accounts/) are a commonly used authentication method for services like continuous integration (CI) pipelines and infrastructure-as-code tools.

- [Identity providers](/platform/maintain/access/non-human/wif/) enable secure access to Mondoo spaces without stored credentials.

- [API tokens](/platform/maintain/access/non-human/api-tokens/) let users communicate with Mondoo's GraphQL API.
