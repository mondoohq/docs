---

Rely on Mondoo to secure all aspects of your Amazon cloud environment. Mondoo finds vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in instances, Kubernetes, buckets, APIs, and more.

Mondoo offers a variety of approaches to evaluating your AWS infrastructure security. You can continuously scan your AWS accounts, evaluate builds before they go to production, and run ad hoc scans.

## Continuously scan

Continuously evaluate the security of your AWS accounts and resources, such as EC2 instances, so that you always have an up-to-date view of your environment's security posture.

The [Mondoo AWS Integration](/platform/infra/cloud/aws/aws-integration-scan) provides continuous scanning of your AWS accounts. Deploy the integration once and always get the latest security assessments for new accounts and resources.

## Scan during build time

[Build Secure AMIs with cnspec and HashiCorp Packer](/cnspec/cloud/aws/packer/): Scan Linux and Windows HashiCorp Packer builds for vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations. Mondoo's plugin works with any of the supported Packer builders, including containers.

## Scan during run time

Mondoo's client, cnspec, provides many ways to [run ad hoc, agentless scans](/cnspec/cloud/aws/).
