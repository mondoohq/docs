You can configure Mondoo to send a message to a Slack channel whenever there's a change to an asset's security score. You do this by integrating Slack with the Mondoo space from which you want to receive alerts.

Before you set up the integration, you must create an incoming webhook app for Slack.

## Create and customize an incoming webhook in Slack
