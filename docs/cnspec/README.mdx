## Scan locally

Use the `cnspec scan` command to check local and remote targets for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. cnspec detects the target platform and runs policy checks specific to that system.

This command evaluates the security of your local machine:

```bash
cnspec scan local
```

This (truncated) sample result shows the individual checks that cnspec performs according to the policy. It includes a summary of the scan with a letter grade:

```
Asset: (macOS) Mac.localdomain
------------------------------

Passing:
✓ Control access to audit records
✓ Disable Bonjour advertising service
✓ Disable Content Caching
✓ Disable File Sharing
...
✓ Password Age
✓ Password History
✓ Retain install.log for 365 or more days with no maximum size
✓ Set a minimum password length

Failing:
✕ MEDIUM (40):    Reduce the sudo timeout period


Scanned 1 asset

macOS
  LOW (1):      Mac.localdomain
```

## Scan remote targets

You can also specify remote targets to scan.

This example scans a docker image:

```bash
cnspec scan docker image ubuntu:24.04
```

This scans an aws account using the local AWS configuration profile:

```bash
cnspec scan aws
```

This scans a Kubernetes cluster using your local kubectl config:

```bash
cnspec scan k8s
```

This scans a GitHub repository:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<personal_access_token>
cnspec scan github repo <org/repo>
```

## Create a JSON report

To save the results of your scan to a JSON file, append your scan command with the `-o` flag:

```
-o json > FILENAME.json
```

For `FILENAME`, substitute the name you want to give the file. For example, this scans a Kubernetes cluster and reports the results to a file named `k8s-test-results.json`:

```bash
cnspec scan k8s -o json > k8s-test-results.json
```
