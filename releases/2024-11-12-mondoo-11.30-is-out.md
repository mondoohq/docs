## üéâ NEW FEATURES

### Notes for cases

Cases are an important way to communicate with the team fixing security issues. Now you can provide the context that downstream teams need to remediate problems quickly: When you create a case, you can write a note, which automatically syncs to your ticketing or project management system.

### Package data in Windows snapshot scans

You can now expose package vulnerabilities on Windows cloud hosts without deploying agents. Windows cloud snapshot scans now include package discovery.

  0: {
    fsck: 1
    options: "defaults,noatime"
