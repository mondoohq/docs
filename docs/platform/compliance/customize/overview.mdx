Because every business, organization, and space has unique needs and requirements, Mondoo lets you customize your compliance.

- Define the [_scope_](/platform/compliance/customize/scope) of your compliance audit: If your auditor doesn't need data about a certain control, you can set the control out of scope.

- Set an _exception_ to exclude a [control](/platform/compliance/customize/exceptions) or [check](/platform/compliance/customize/exceptions-checks) temporarily or indefinitely from your compliance score and communicate the decision with your team. To focus your team on complying with the highest priority benchmarks, set exceptions on the lower priorities for now. Or if certain requirements in a framework don't make sense for your space, disable them and provide an explanation why.
