Set up cases in a space to allow users in the space to keep track of security tasks from within the Mondoo Console. Create an email integration to automatically send email to your ticket, issue tracking, or project management system when you create a new case. Your ticket system's email listener or service receives the email and generates a ticket using the information Mondoo includes in the email.

For an overview of cases, read [Track and Fix Findings with Cases and Your Ticket System](/platform/cases/overview/).

You can set up multiple recipients for case email messages. When you create a new case, a drop-down lets you choose the recipient for that case. This is helpful for teams with different methods for tracking different types of tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Owner or Editor access to the Mondoo space

- A listener or similar service set up in your ticket system, such as the Zendesk email channel, ServiceNow inbound email, or the Jira incoming mail handler.

## Add an email integration for cases

1. In the Mondoo Console, navigate to the space where you want to set up cases and, in the side navigation bar, select **Cases**.

4. In the **Choose an integration name** box, enter a name for the integration. Make it a name that clearly shows the purpose of the integration.

5. Under **Recipient 1**, provide information about where to send case email messages:

   - The **Name** identifies the recipient. This displays in the recipients drop-down list when you add a new case.

   - The **Email address** is where Mondoo directs the email message.

   - You can include a **Reference link** to provide a link to the ticket system from the case details page in Mondoo.

6. To add another option for where to send case email messages, select ***ADD A RECIPIENT** and provide the details for Recipient 2, 3, and so on.

7. Select the **CREATE INTEGRATION** button.
